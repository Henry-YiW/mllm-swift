The 7-2 decision was a victory for Arizona and other states that have attempted to crack down on voter fraud. By a vote of 7-2, the Supreme Court upheld Arizona's voter registration law . The court said the controversial law did not violate the National Voter Registration Act . The decision was cheered by Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer . The ruling was a victory for Arizona and other states that have attempted to crack down on voter fraud . The National Voter Registration Act of 1993, also known as the Motor Voter law, requires states to ask people registering to vote to provide proof of citizenship only if they are not registered to vote in any other state. The ruling, written by Justice Antonin Scalia, said the Arizona law did not violate the NVRA. \"The National Voter Registration Act provides that a state may not impose any additional requirements on an applicant for voter registration beyond those enumerated in the federal form,\" Scalia wrote. \"However, nothing in the NVRA precludes Arizona from requiring those who apply for registration under the federal form to prove U.S. citizenship by providing additional information.\" The other justices who joined Scalia's opinion were Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor. Justices Elena Kagan and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented. The court's decision was cheered by Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer . \"Today's ruling is a victory for the people of Arizona and the integrity of our elections,\" she said in a statement. \"As I have stated before, Arizona has a right and a responsibility to ensure the integrity of our elections process.

Clapper said that the surveillance program would be moved to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court, which oversees the warrantless wiretapping of foreigners suspected of terrorism.

The explosion killed at least 33 people and injured more than 100 others, public health spokesman Najibullah Kamawal said. The ISIS terrorist group claimed responsibility for the attack. The claim appears to be the first in Afghanistan by ISIS, CNN's Nick Paton Walsh said. It was made by an offshoot called ISIS Wilayat Khorasan. In a statement, the group said the bomber was named Abu Mohammad and he belonged to their ranks. He was targeting government workers collecting their pay at the bank, the terrorists said. He detonated his charge at the peak of rush hour on the first day of the week, when the bank would be expected to be crowded. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid, in a text message to journalists, distanced his group from the attack. \"The explosion in Jalalabad doesn't have anything to do with us and we condemn it,\" he said. ISIS refers to Afghanistan and Pakistan as the province of \"Khorasan.\" In March, CNN reported on ISIS recruiting in Afghanistan. The United Nations condemned the violence. \"The continuing use of suicide attacks in densely populated areas, that are certain to kill and maim large numbers of Afghan civilians, may amount to a war crime,\" said Nicholas Haysom, head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. The United Nations said that in the first three months of the year 655 people were killed and 1,155 were wounded in suicide attacks throughout the country. Fears about ISIS involvement in the region have been growing this year. In February, Mullah Abdul Rauf, a former Taliban commander who had become a recruiter for ISIS in Afghanistan, was killed in a drone strike, according to officials who spoke to CNN.

He is the lone officer among the 13 who fired their weapons that night who is charged criminally because prosecutors say he stood on the hood and opened fire four seconds after the other officers had stopped shooting . Brelo's attorney Patrick D'Angelo conceded that his tactics could be called into question given that Brelo exposed himself to danger when he stepped onto the hood of a beat-up Chevy Malibu to fire 15 rounds into the windshield of the suspects' vehicle . But Brelo and 12 officers who shot a total of 137 rounds into the car in November 2012 had ample reason to believe that Russell and Williams were shooting at them, he said . Self defense?

D'Angelo said he wasn't calling what Brelo and the other officers did that night heroic . 'They are simple, ordinary people who try to do the best they can and are put in very dangerous situations,' he said . Brelo, charged with voluntary manslaughter, is the only officer charged because prosecutors said he waited until after the initial salvo had ended to reload and discharge the last of the 49 rounds he fired that night . A judge will decide whether Brelo is guilty or innocent . He faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison if convicted . Assistant Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Rick Bell revealed that experts have concluded that another officer fired three rounds during Brelo's 15-shot volley, something defense attorneys have argued in motions .

But for paleontologist Emma Schachner, the excitement is palpable. We're here to unwrap a fossil skull that's been held in the Field Museum's collections since 1927, she says, as she carefully unpeels layers of plaster and linen from the rare find. The skull -- which will be on display at the museum from Wednesday -- has been identified as the oldest known member of the Homo group, which includes modern humans and their ancestors. The Field Museum's Emma Schachner unwraps the fossilized skull of the oldest known member of the Homo group . The skull is the oldest known of the Homo group, which includes modern humans and their ancestors . The skull was found in 1927 in the city of Dmanisi, Georgia, by a Soviet paleontologist, and was then stored in Georgia's National Museum. It was only in 1991, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, that the skull was sent to the Field Museum for further analysis. Dating the skull proved difficult, as the type of radiocarbon dating used to date fossils was not available at the time. However, the results of other dating techniques, including thermoluminescence and electron spin resonance, were consistent. The skull is believed to be from a 20 million-year-old Homo species .

Scientists believe they could soon be able to print out a kidney for transplant without the need for immunosuppressant drugs. Surgeons in the US have created a 3D printed kidney which works in the lab and could be used in humans within the next few years. Researchers at Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine in North Carolina and the University of North Carolina used a $200,000 3D printer to create the kidney. The organ was made from a patient's own stem cells and will be able to be used in people without the need for immunosuppressants. The scientists hope that the procedure will be welcomed by doctors and patients alike as it will mean that fewer people will have to wait for a donor kidney. Some 100,000 people in the US are on the waiting list for a kidney transplant and 13 people die waiting for a kidney every day. The breakthrough will also reduce the risk of organ rejection and will mean that the patient will not need to take immunosuppressant drugs for the rest of their life, which have been linked to cancer and heart disease. However, the downside is that the procedure will cost around $100,000, far more than the cost of a regular transplant. The US researchers made the kidney by taking a biopsy of a kidney from a patient and then isolating the stem cells. Auspiciously, they were able to create a kidney from stem cells from a mouse, an advance that took 10 years to achieve. Scientists hope that the procedure will be welcomed by doctors and patients alike as it will mean that fewer people will have to wait for a donor kidney .

The images are of a mystery man, but the books are undeniably famous. On the east wall, the volumes are locked in a glass case. They are the first 48 volumes of \"The encyclopedia Britannica,\" published between 1768 and 1833. On the west wall, slightly more modern, lie the tenth and 11th editions of that same encyclopedia, published in the 1870s and 1890s. The man whose face is on the wall is K.C. Bray, who worked at the encyclopedia's offices in Chicago for 43 years. The photograph was taken in 1922, when Bray was 22 and working as a typist. This year, he would have turned 115. The old photographs turned up after the primary care physician of Bray's granddaughter, Leslie Bray, died. The physician's widow, Connie, was searching through family photos and happened upon the images. She sent them to Leslie, who was certain they were of the same old man whose face she had seen framed on the wall since she was a child. But she had no idea how the photographs came to be there. Leslie Bray, who lives in Evanston, Illinois, said she had always been curious about the books and wondered if perhaps they were K.C. Bray's. But she never asked. Then, one day after her grandfather died, while she was visiting her grandmother, a woman came into the room. \"She kind of looked at me and smiled and caught my eye,\" Bray said. \"She said, 'Keep an eye on those books for me.' \" Bray said she went to her grandmother and asked who the woman was.

Samuels claimed inexperienced Stokes is 'battling himself' and that England 'can't help' talking to him . Samuels was put on his back by Stuart Broad, who bowled too short on day one but got value for this bouncer .

Walking around flat-footed, penguin-like, the giant bird is a new species discovered by scientists. While the species has been spotted before in the Pantanal region, this is the first time scientists have picked up on the bird's unique coloring. The ornithologists from the Palmares Ecological Station in the Pantanal and the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in southern Brazil first spotted the bird after a photo was posted on social media. The picture was taken by photographer Fernando Monteiro, who was surveying the area for the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources. The scientists were able to identify the bird as a subspecies of the common rhea, what's known as the \"greater rhea.\" The greater rhea is a flightless bird that, like the lesser rhea, is native to South America. The common rhea is the largest bird in the Americas, native to southern South America. It's a flightless bird that can grow up to 5 feet tall and weigh up to 60 pounds. What's unique about the bird is that it lacks the common rhea's brown and black coloring. Instead, the greater rhea is entirely white. \"The new species is a white rhea, while the common rhea is usually brown and black,\" said Dr. Claudio Jordan, a wildlife veterinarian and one of the scientists who discovered the bird. \"The animals are existent in the Pantanal region, but we had never seen one before.\" The species is the first new rhea species ever discovered, said Jordan. The ornithologists are currently working on a comparison of the genetic codes of the greater rhea and the common rhea to determine whether the two species are actually different.

Letter from Pope Francis to Cafe Roma . The Vatican said the letter was aimed at stopping the \"media campaign\" being waged by a former papal butler, Paolo Gabriele, who was convicted in 2012 of stealing confidential documents, including letters from Pope Benedict XVI. Gabriele was convicted of theft but pardoned by the pope. In the letter, Pope Francis said he had talked to Gabriele and that he seemed to want to drop his \"media campaign\" and settle his differences with the Vatican. \"I confess that I am very saddened by this situation,\" the pope wrote. Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said the letter was aimed at Francis' intention to bring peace back to the Vatican, which has been rocked by a series of scandals. \"It is not a confrontation with the Vatican, but a desire to cut off a media campaign ... that is being waged against the Vatican,\" he said. \"The pope is not interested in apportioning blame, but in denouncing a media campaign that is going on.\" Lombardi said no one was being accused of anything in the letter. Gabriele's lawyer and a filmmaker who has had access to Gabriele said the letter was aimed at stopping a new book and documentary about the Vatican. Last year, the Vatican said it was investigating allegations involving a priest, the Rev.

And now, nearly a decade later, Toyota is introducing the third generation of the Prius. The 2014 Prius is bigger, more powerful and more aggressive than its predecessors. It has a 1.8-liter engine (up from 1.5), a more powerful electric motor and a brand new look. The revamped model is flashier and more powerful than the original Prius.

Toyota&nbsp;has developed a special hybrid synergy drive system that lets the vehicle switch into electric drive mode at low speeds, and provides a smooth transition between regular gasoline and electric power. The system also allows the Prius to switch into electric drive mode at higher speeds. So, no matter how fast your driving, the Prius will be more efficient than ever.

But he will primarily be remembered as a musical genius, a performer who kept the impossible dream of the Motown sound alive when it seemed as if it had come to an end. The King of Pop, as he became known, was tall, thin and, in later years, pale. He was a self-confessed shut-in, who had a $1m-a-month pill habit and was addicted to plastic surgery. Among his many able imitators was the rapper Snoop Dogg, his former neighbour in the Los Angeles mansion where he died. But Jackson was not just a performer. Like Elvis before him, he was also a trendsetter. He blazed a trail for the modern music video, paving the way for today's MTV stars. Like Elvis, too, he was a man who was never quite at ease in his own skin. He was a black man who wanted to be white, a child who wanted to be an adult, and an adult who wanted to be a child. He was the most famous black man in the world, but he never felt at home in the black community. He performed for presidents and popes, yet he felt like an outsider. He was a consummate performer, yet he baulked at the idea of performing in public. Jackson was born in Gary, Indiana, and was the seventh of nine children. His admiration for Elvis Presley was apparent from the age of five, and he would later say that he had wanted to be a performer since he was \"a little boy with an orange juice box\". He was a child star, performing with his brothers in the Jackson Five, and he was only 11 when he sang the vocals on a song called Little Bitty Pretty One. He labelled Charles Manson a \"sick genius\" after the serial killer sent him a fawning letter. He was accused of child molestation in 1993 by a 13-year-old boy, Jordan Chandler, and the case was settled out of court for $", "decoding_steps": [312], "new_tokens": [514], "wall_time": [18.510331630706787], "accept_lengths": [2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2], "acceptance_rate": 0.5787965616045845}], "tstamp": 1736453324.1842687}

The volcano has been active for the past four years, but the more recent activity is some of the most intense since an eruption in 1992.

The observatory said the volcano is not currently erupting. Sampling in the most recent eruption showed that the volcano was producing a type of magma that is explosive, according to the observatory.

Italian Alex Bellini is to be subjected to the full force of the iceberg as it melts, cracks and even flips - while hopefully staying safe inside his small spherical cabin. The aim of the cabin fever-inducing stunt is to highlight how global warming will melt icebergs around the world and cause sea levels to rise. Scroll down for video . Italian Alex Bellini will live atop an iceberg in Greenland starting next year. He will live inside a contained ball (artist's illustration shown), with no means to escape for 12 months. The capsule will be 10ft (three metres) wide and could fit 10 people - but Mr Bellini will remove all of the seats apart from one, for himself . Mr Bellini, 36, is seeking funding for his project, called Adrift, which he hopes to begin in November 2016. Previous feats by the explorer include running more than 14,000 miles (22,500km), rowing more than 21,000 miles (34,000km) and spending 560 days in isolation. He has rowed both the Atlantic and Pacific and insists he favours challenges where there is a perceived lack of control. The capsules, initially designed essentially as escape pods for areas at risk of tsunami, can hold from two to ten people and range in price from \u00a38,000 to \u00a313,500 ($12,000 to $20,000). Four are currently in use in Japan, while two are in the US. Mr Bellini will use one at the upper scale, 10ft (three metres) wide - although he\u2019ll remove all the seats except one for himself.

The drug, also known as L-glutamine, is used to treat the most common inherited blood disorder in the United States, according to the FDA. Sickle cell disease affects about 100,000 Americans, according to the National Institute of Health.

But the gap between the United States and China is stark. According to a new Wall Street Journal - Nielsen online survey, 47% of Chinese Internet users are online at least once a day, compared to just 32% of Americans. Among the 55 countries surveyed, China, India, Brazil and the United States are the only countries that have Internet penetration rates above 30%. The survey also found that the average Chinese Internet user regularly visits 18 websites, compared to 13 for Americans. That's not a huge difference, but it's a nice reminder of how much bigger China is than the United States. There are nearly 10 times as many Chinese Internet users as Americans. And while some of that is due to the fact that China has a younger population overall, the survey found that Chinese Internet users are more likely to be in the 18-24 age group than Americans. According to the International Telecommunication Union, China has the world's largest number of Internet users, with just over 400 million. The U.S. is second with 240 million.

The process of cloud seeding was first proposed in the 1940s at the General Electric labs in Schenectady, New York. Two decades later, the Central Arizona Project and the Salt River Project invested in research to make it a reality. 'It hasn't been taken off the table as a potential tool as we work our way through drought now and in the future,' Nancy Selover, Arizona's state climatologist told Becky Brisley at Cronkite News. Since 2007, CAP has put about $1 million toward research happening in other states to increase the supply of water in the Colorado River system.

The professor is one of many scientists from around the world are actively looking at manipulating the weather as a way of combating climate change. Professor Robock told the callers that any attempts to meddle with the weather on a large scale would be detectable. The system works on the premise that rainfall takes place when supercooled droplets of water form ice crystals. As a result they become too heavy to remain suspended in the air, and fall, often melting on their way down to form rain.

The Daniel Day-Lewis-starring film was followed by heavyweights Argo and Life of Pi, which both received eight nominations.

Ben Affleck, who was snubbed by the Directors' Guild of America, was included in the best director category, along with Spielberg, Ang Lee, David O. Russell and\u00a0Michael Haneke. Close behind Affleck in that category was Kathryn Bigelow, who was passed over for a DGA nomination despite her film Zero Dark Thirty being nominated for best picture.\nSummary: On the morning of nominations..\nArticle: The 2013 Academy Awards nominations were predicted to be a well-balanced selection of films, and the final list has proved to be just that, with \u2018Lincoln\u2019 and \u2018Life of Pi\u2019 leading the nominations with eleven each.

The apparently haunting photograph was posted on Facebook by Australian Kim Davison, from Queensland. Social media users are claiming that the white shape at the back of the image, circled, shows a ghostly face. Photo was taken at Murphy's Hole which is the same location 13-year-old Doreen O'Sullivan drowned in 1915 . Was it Doreen O'Sullivan' ghost? Ms Davison claims her daughter's leg was grabbed by something in the water . The image appeared to show two women and four children swimming at Murphy's Hole in the Lockyer River, south-east Queensland. But Ms Davison and Jessie Lu, the other adult in the photo, were adamant they were only accompanied by three children. It provoked fierce discussion online after it was revealed a little girl had died in the watering hole a century prior. A Brisbane Courier newspaper clipping from November 22 1913 included a death notice for a little girl who died in that watering hole. 'Doreen O Sullivan, aged 13 years, eldest daughter of Mr. James O'Sullivan was accidentally drowned whilst bathing in the Lockyer Creek on Friday afternoon,' the notice read.

From Friday to Monday, a total of 8,480 migrants were rescued, according to the Italian coast guard, which said it received on Monday -- alone -- SOS calls from 20 boats in distress. On Tuesday, a spokesman with Save the Children told CNN the group fears 400 migrants could be missing, citing testimony from survivors who said their ship carrying 550 people capsized in the Mediterranean Sea about 80 miles off the Libyan coast. The Italian coast guard, however, told CNN that while it is taking the report seriously, it cannot confirm such an incident and has not yet found evidence at sea to indicate a migrant boat carrying approximately 550 has capsized with 145 rescued. An operation that included boats and planes did not find any survivors, nor bodies, nor any evidence to indicate a particular boat capsized, Coast Guard official Filippo Marini said. There has been a recent upsurge in migrant boats crossing the Mediterranean into Italy and an increase in rescues performed by the Italian Coast Guard to aid migrant boats. Why migrants are dying trying to reach Italy . According to the International Organization for Migration, Italy registered more than 10,000 migrants arriving in the first three months of 2015, and about 2,000 were rescued at sea during the first weekend of April in the Channel of Sicily. Most migrants recorded this year come from countries in West Africa as well as Somalia and Syria, the IOM said. They use Libya as a country of transit. At least 480 migrants have died while crossing the Mediterranean since the beginning of the year, often because of bad weather and overcrowded vessels used by smugglers, the IOM said. Sometimes the captains and crews abandon the ships, leaving passengers to fend for themselves. Last week: 978 migrants rescued in one day in Mediterranean Sea .

The Women's Health Initiative in the US and the Million Women Study in the UK have both revealed strong evidence that HRT increases a woman's risk of breast, womb and ovarian cancers . The Million Women Study, a collaboration between Cancer Research UK and the NHS, results suggested that women who are using combined HRT have double the risk of breast cancer compared to non-users . And researchers found if women use HRT for more than 10 years, their risks are even higher .

After going through the menopause a woman's ovaries stop producing the hormone oestrogen . It triggers menopausal symptoms including hot flashes and mood swings . HRT treats the body by introducing female sex hormones .

The asteroid is currently about 1.5 million miles from Earth. A giant asteroid is hurtling toward Earth. But fear not, it's not coming close enough to hit us -- at least not for the next 100 years. That's the calculated time frame for when the space rock, named 2014 HQ124, will make its closest approach to Earth. And even then it will be at a safe distance of about 13 million miles, or 53 times the distance between Earth and the moon. The massive asteroid was first discovered on April 23 by the University of Hawaii's Pan-STARRS 1 telescope on Haleakala, Hawaii. It was later observed by astronomers using the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. That's when it was determined that the asteroid was forging a path toward Earth. Now, the space rock is on a trajectory that will bring it within 1.5 million miles of Earth on May 15. However, the asteroid will not impact Earth. \"There is no chance of an impact anywhere on Earth,\" said Patrick Paolucci, a research scientist at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California. \"The closest approach to Earth will be about 13 million miles, which is 53 times the distance between Earth and the moon.\" Paolucci, who is a member of the Arecibo Observatory's asteroid radar facility, said the space rock will be visible to astronomers for the next 12 days or so. He said the Arecibo Observatory will further track the space rock's path. \"We think it's a pretty big asteroid,\" he said. \"It's about 400 meters in diameter, which is about a quarter of a mile.\" Paolucci said that while it's not going to hit Earth, the passage of the asteroid is still a big deal. \"This is significant because we're going to spend the next 12 days or so tracking this asteroid,\" he said", "decoding_steps": [274], "new_tokens": [514], "wall_time": [17.97648286819458], "accept_lengths": [7, 3, 1, 9, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 6, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 10, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 2, 1, 3, 4, 4, 1, 4, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2], "acceptance_rate": 0.6282722513089005}], "tstamp": 1736453946.8115203}

Gema, a group representing Spanish composers and music publishers, said the ruling was a victory for people who create music. But YouTube said it was disappointed with the ruling. The service, owned by Google, said it would work to ensure it complied with the ruling. \"We're disappointed with the decision and believe it creates uncertainty for both the creative community and internet platforms,\" said a spokesman. \"We'll be working closely with the music publishing industry and other stakeholders to understand the implications of today's ruling.\" The European Court of Justice said that the new ruling will apply to all 28 countries in the European Union. It said that the downloaded video must be removed from the internet. The suit was brought by Spanish musician Rosana Arbelo, also known as Rosana. She claimed that the video-sharing site had allowed users to upload her song Amanecer without permission. \"This is a great victory for all the composers and authors and for all the creators of intellectual production in Europe,\" said Gema's president Albert Martinez.

Visitors to Pennsylvania's Carnegie Science Center can see the sun way up close.  The Buzz Aldrin Space Exploration Pavilion is hosting a $15 million exhibit called \"Destination Solar System.\"  The exhibit is where visitors can get a once-in-a-lifetime look at the surface of the sun.  The exhibit is the result of a partnership between NASA and the Science Center. \"Destination Solar System\" features a 360-degree theater, collapsible telescopes and a giant sun sculpture that visitors can walk through.  But the star of the show is the 3-D model of the sun's surface.  Submitted by the Science CenterGeorge Diller, the Science Center's president and CEO, said the exhibit is an opportunity to show people how the sun works.  \"We're going to be able to show them that the sun is actually a ball of fire, literally, and that the surface of that ball of fire is extremely active,\" Diller said.  For the animators who created the exhibit, the challenge was getting the models to look as realistic as possible.  \"The sun is so big that it's hard to get a clear picture of how it looks if you were standing beneath it,\" said Greg Bothun, a scientist at the National Solar Observatory.  \"We had to use a lot of computer modeling to get the sun to look like it should.\"  The model is based on images taken by the Solar Dynamics Observatory, a NASA satellite that studies the sun.  The day-night cycle on the model is animated using images from NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory.  The exhibit also features several interactive displays that allow visitors to learn about the sun's history and the science behind solar eclipses.  Visitors can also try their hand at painting the sun's surface.  \"Destination Solar System\" is expected to be on display at the Science Center through 2018.\nSummary: (CNN) -- The band of the sun is a place of intense activity and violent explosions.

The passenger accused of beating an elderly couple on a luxury cruise ship claimed yesterday the violence erupted in a row over an awkward silence at dinner. Graeme Finlay, 53, insisted he acted in self-defence after being attacked by Ron Phillips, 70, wielding his crutch. The 16-stone British Gas engineer, who was travelling alone, confronted Mr Phillips and his wife June, 69, about their rudeness in ignoring him when he joined their table for dinner, a court heard. The couple were knocked unconscious after he allegedly assaulted them outside their cabin. But yesterday Finlay said he only swung his arms to defend himself when Mr Phillips went for him with his crutch. He denied attacking Mrs Phillips. He claimed Mr Phillips threw a cup of cocoa in his face and hit him with the crutch when he demanded an apology. He told the court: \u2018I felt myself being struck by something sharp and I put my arms over my face to defend myself \u2013 I covered my face with my arms, I didn\u2019t want my eye poked out.\u2019 He said he swung his arms outwards and felt them connect with retired engineer Mr Phillips, from Middlesbrough.

He is charged with one count of possession and intent to distribute methamphetamine and one count of importing a controlled substance.

Sen Cochran's spokesman Chris Gallegos confirmed a staff member had been arrested but refused to confirm further details. He told the City Paper: 'Our office is in the process of consulting with Senate legal counsel.' GBL, the drug Cochran allegedly acquired from a dealer in China, is similar to the date rape drug GHB.

A retired general is being sued over a murder in Northern Ireland more than 40 years ago. Sir Frank Kitson, who is 88, is accused in the case of Patrick Eugene Heenan, a Catholic killed by loyalists in 1973. It is the first time a retired senior officer has been personally sued over the Troubles. Yesterday however, Sir Frank said he was confused as to why he was being named because he was not even serving in Northern Ireland at the time. He learned of the legal action in a letter from a Belfast law firm at the weekend. Mr Heenan, 47, was killed when paramilitaries threw a grenade at a minibus carrying him and 14 others to a Belfast building site. His widow, Mary, is suing the Ministry of Defence and the general, claiming he died because of \u2018negligence and misfeasance\u2019. But Sir Frank told the Daily Mail he had no connection to the case. \u2018I wasn\u2019t even there in 1973,\u2019 he said. \u2018I was in Ireland from September 1970 until April 1972.

Dannel Malloy's decision allowing a teenager who refused chemotherapy to remain in custody of the state.\nArticle: (FOX News) -- A Connecticut teenager who ran away from her home after being diagnosed with cancer and refused chemotherapy will remain in state custody, a judge ruled Wednesday. Judge Elizabeth Bozzuto denied a motion to let 17-year-old Cassandra C. go home, saying the girl's mother, Jackie Fortin, had not shown that she or her daughter would comply with the court's orders. Doctors surgically implanted a port in Cassandra's chest to administer chemotherapy medications, beginning in spite of legal maneuvers to halt them. Cassandra is feeling well and is in good shape as far as her health is concerned, according to Michtom. \"She's seen in her case the side effects weren't bad, and she's been well-treated by the nurses and doctors and does want to complete the treatment,\" he said. Her treatment is scheduled to wrap up this month. Michtom and Taylor failed in their effort before the Connecticut Supreme Court to make the case that Cassandra was mature enough to make her own medical decisions. Joette Katz, the commissioner of the Department of Children and Families, told CNN in March the agency is \"very pleased with Cassandra's progress toward a complete recovery. We understand how difficult this has been for Cassandra and her family, but we have had full confidence throughout that the medical professionals involved in her treatment would be successful in saving her life.\" The agency has denied CNN's request to speak with Cassandra or her physicians. According to Michtom, the Department of Children and Families could have withdrawn its position for an order of custody but hasn't. He said the department sees Cassandra as a flight risk because she has run away before. Representatives for the department have said in court and in conversations with Michtom and Taylor that they will withdraw their pending neglect petition once Cassandra completes her last round of chemo -- expected around the end of April -- and that she'll be allowed to return home.

McElroy said she was 'mortified' and 'in terrible shape' when she found out what she had done, she wrote in a column for the Washington Post. Respected Drexel University law professor Lisa McElroy, 50, who made national headlines last month after accidentally emailing her students a porn link, has spoken out about reclaiming her dignity since the scandal . The legal writing professor, who earned a doctorate from Harvard Law School, writes that she was sure she had lost her 'dignity forever' when news of the scandal first broke. 'Everyone was talking about me,' she said. 'Everyone was speculating about whether I watched porn, or used sex toys, or liked kinky sex. Some people were calling for my job and law license.' The professor said she would not divulge in her column how the mistake happened. 'If you're hoping to find out here how that happened, among the many possibilities that have been raised by gleeful commentators, I\u2019m sorry to tell you you\u2019re going to be disappointed.' But McElroy did explain her concern that, with a profession where she teaches 'students to project a dignified image' and 'possess integrity', people would no longer believe the teacher could follow her own lessons. Drexel conducted an internal investigation after the incident and found that McElroy, a tenured professor, had not violated the the university's sexual harassment and misconduct policy. The university said in a statement that federal law requires it investigate all reports of 'inappropriate behaviors of a sexual nature'.

The 7-2 decision was a victory for Arizona and other states that have attempted to crack down on voter fraud. By a vote of 7-2, the Supreme Court upheld Arizona's voter registration law . The court said the controversial law did not violate the National Voter Registration Act . The decision was cheered by Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer . The ruling was a victory for Arizona and other states that have attempted to crack down on voter fraud . The National Voter Registration Act of 1993, also known as the Motor Voter law, requires states to ask people registering to vote to provide proof of citizenship only if they are not registered to vote in any other state. The ruling, written by Justice Antonin Scalia, said the Arizona law did not violate the NVRA. \"The National Voter Registration Act provides that a state may not impose any additional requirements on an applicant for voter registration beyond those enumerated in the federal form,\" Scalia wrote. \"However, nothing in the NVRA precludes Arizona from requiring those who apply for registration under the federal form to prove U.S. citizenship by providing additional information.\" The other justices who joined Scalia's opinion were Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor. Justices Elena Kagan and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented. The court's decision was cheered by Arizona Gov.

The National Security Agency (NSA) would no longer collect records of US phone calls and would instead rely on an existing program that targets foreigners, according to James Clapper, the director of national intelligence. Clapper said that the program, first revealed by The Guardian newspaper, had helped foil a terrorist plot in 2009 to bomb two New York City subway lines. News of the program prompted a furious debate in the United States over the level of surveillance that the government can conduct on its citizens. The National Security Agency (NSA) will no longer collect phone records of Americans, a senior official said . The NSA will rely on an existing program that targets foreigners, according to James Clapper, the director of national intelligence ). The uproar led President Barack Obama to order a review of all US surveillance programs to ensure they are legal and do not infringe on civil liberties. The existence of the phone records program was revealed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, who leaked classified documents to the media. Clapper said that the surveillance program would be moved to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court, which oversees the warrantless wiretapping of foreigners suspected of terrorism. The court would also be allowed to approve the program, which would be service providers, not the National Security Agency, that would collect the phone records, he added. \"The FISA court order will only be used to obtain call detail records of a foreign target", "decoding_steps": [243], "new_tokens": [513], "wall_time": [17.793853282928467], "accept_lengths": [2, 4, 3, 8, 2, 2, 2, 9, 3, 1, 2, 6, 9, 5, 2, 6, 3, 2, 1, 1, 6, 2, 14, 2, 6, 3, 3, 1, 2, 4, 2, 15, 10, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 5, 6, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.675}], "tstamp": 1736455113.214633}

The explosion killed at least 33 people and injured more than 100 others, public health spokesman Najibullah Kamawal said. The ISIS terrorist group claimed responsibility for the attack. The claim appears to be the first in Afghanistan by ISIS, CNN's Nick Paton Walsh said. It was made by an offshoot called ISIS Wilayat Khorasan. In a statement, the group said the bomber was named Abu Mohammad and he belonged to their ranks. He was targeting government workers collecting their pay at the bank, the terrorists said. He detonated his charge at the peak of rush hour on the first day of the week, when the bank would be expected to be crowded. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid, in a text message to journalists, distanced his group from the attack. \"The explosion in Jalalabad doesn't have anything to do with us and we condemn it,\" he said. ISIS refers to Afghanistan and Pakistan as the province of \"Khorasan.\" In March, CNN reported on ISIS recruiting in Afghanistan. The United Nations condemned the violence. \"The continuing use of suicide attacks in densely populated areas, that are certain to kill and maim large numbers of Afghan civilians, may amount to a war crime,\" said Nicholas Haysom, head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan.

But for paleontologist Emma Schachner, the excitement is palpable. We're here to unwrap a fossil skull that's been held in the Field Museum's collections since 1927, she says, as she carefully unpeels layers of plaster and linen from the rare find. The skull -- which will be on display at the museum from Wednesday -- has been identified as the oldest known member of the Homo group, which includes modern humans and their ancestors. The Field Museum's Emma Schachner unwraps the fossilized skull of the oldest known member of the Homo group . The skull is the oldest known of the Homo group, which includes modern humans and their ancestors . The skull was found in 1927 in the city of Dmanisi, Georgia, by a Soviet paleontologist, and was then stored in Georgia's National Museum. It was only in 1991, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, that the skull was sent to the Field Museum for further analysis. Dating the skull proved difficult, as the type of radiocarbon dating used to date fossils was not available at the time. However, the results of other dating techniques, including thermoluminescence and electron spin resonance, were consistent. The skull is believed to be from a 20 million-year-old Homo species .

Scientists believe they could soon be able to print out a kidney for transplant without the need for immunosuppressant drugs. Surgeons in the US have created a 3D printed kidney which works in the lab and could be used in humans within the next few years. Researchers at Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine in North Carolina and the University of North Carolina used a $200,000 3D printer to create the kidney. The organ was made from a patient's own stem cells and will be able to be used in people without the need for immunosuppressants. The scientists hope that the procedure will be welcomed by doctors and patients alike as it will mean that fewer people will have to wait for a donor kidney. Some 100,000 people in the US are on the waiting list for a kidney transplant and 13 people die waiting for a kidney every day. The breakthrough will also reduce the risk of organ rejection and will mean that the patient will not need to take immunosuppressant drugs for the rest of their life, which have been linked to cancer and heart disease. However, the downside is that the procedure will cost around $100,000, far more than the cost of a regular transplant. The US researchers made the kidney by taking a biopsy of a kidney from a patient and then isolating the stem cells. Auspiciously, they were able to create a kidney from stem cells from a mouse, an advance that took 10 years to achieve. Scientists hope that the procedure will be welcomed by doctors and patients alike as it will mean that fewer people will have to wait for a donor kidney . The stem cells were then placed in a 3D printer and printed out to create a kidney.

The images are of a mystery man, but the books are undeniably famous. On the east wall, the volumes are locked in a glass case. They are the first 48 volumes of \"The encyclopedia Britannica,\" published between 1768 and 1833. On the west wall, slightly more modern, lie the tenth and 11th editions of that same encyclopedia, published in the 1870s and 1890s. The man whose face is on the wall is K.C. Bray, who worked at the encyclopedia's offices in Chicago for 43 years. The photograph was taken in 1922, when Bray was 22 and working as a typist. This year, he would have turned 115. The old photographs turned up after the primary care physician of Bray's granddaughter, Leslie Bray, died. The physician's widow, Connie, was searching through family photos and happened upon the images. She sent them to Leslie, who was certain they were of the same old man whose face she had seen framed on the wall since she was a child. But she had no idea how the photographs came to be there. Leslie Bray, who lives in Evanston, Illinois, said she had always been curious about the books and wondered if perhaps they were K.C. Bray's. But she never asked. Then, one day after her grandfather died, while she was visiting her grandmother, a woman came into the room. \"She kind of looked at me and smiled and caught my eye,\" Bray said. \"She said, 'Keep an eye on those books for me.' \" Bray said she went to her grandmother and asked who the woman was.

In Aurora, near Denver, one person died after being thrown from an Oldsmobile Bravada that lost control and rolled on an icy stretch of Interstate 225, striking a passing public bus. The only person on the bus was its driver, who wasn't hurt. Another person in the Oldsmobile was taken to a hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening, police said. Near Fort Carson, the Colorado State Patrol responded to a series of rush-hour crashes involving a total of nearly 20 cars. In the mountains, Interstate 70 was temporarily closed after several trucks spun out on snowy Vail Pass. At lower elevations, the storm left only light snow on grass, and roads were largely clear because of recent warm weather. However, motorists driving at normal speeds were surprised by icy patches, especially on bridges, said Trooper James Schmidt of the Colorado State Patrol. 'We're in Colorado.

Walking around flat-footed, penguin-like, the giant bird is a new species discovered by scientists. While the species has been spotted before in the Pantanal region, this is the first time scientists have picked up on the bird's unique coloring. The ornithologists from the Palmares Ecological Station in the Pantanal and the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in southern Brazil first spotted the bird after a photo was posted on social media. The picture was taken by photographer Fernando Monteiro, who was surveying the area for the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources. The scientists were able to identify the bird as a subspecies of the common rhea, what's known as the \"greater rhea.\" The greater rhea is a flightless bird that, like the lesser rhea, is native to South America. The common rhea is the largest bird in the Americas, native to southern South America. It's a flightless bird that can grow up to 5 feet tall and weigh up to 60 pounds. What's unique about the bird is that it lacks the common rhea's brown and black coloring. Instead, the greater rhea is entirely white. \"The new species is a white rhea, while the common rhea is usually brown and black,\" said Dr. Claudio Jordan, a wildlife veterinarian and one of the scientists who discovered the bird. \"The animals are existent in the Pantanal region, but we had never seen one before.\" The species is the first new rhea species ever discovered, said Jordan.

The pipeline is a divisive issue among congressional Democrats. Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Barbara Boxer of California oppose the project, while Sen.

Letter from Pope Francis to Cafe Roma . The Vatican said the letter was aimed at stopping the \"media campaign\" being waged by a former papal butler, Paolo Gabriele, who was convicted in 2012 of stealing confidential documents, including letters from Pope Benedict XVI. Gabriele was convicted of theft but pardoned by the pope. In the letter, Pope Francis said he had talked to Gabriele and that he seemed to want to drop his \"media campaign\" and settle his differences with the Vatican. \"I confess that I am very saddened by this situation,\" the pope wrote. Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said the letter was aimed at Francis' intention to bring peace back to the Vatican, which has been rocked by a series of scandals. \"It is not a confrontation with the Vatican, but a desire to cut off a media campaign ... that is being waged against the Vatican,\" he said. \"The pope is not interested in apportioning blame, but in denouncing a media campaign that is going on.\" Lombardi said no one was being accused of anything in the letter. Gabriele's lawyer and a filmmaker who has had access to Gabriele said the letter was aimed at stopping a new book and documentary about the Vatican. Last year, the Vatican said it was investigating allegations involving a priest, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, who was a close friend of Gabriele's and a secretary to Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, the former chief of staff to Pope Benedict XVI. The priest, the Rev.

But he will primarily be remembered as a musical genius, a performer who kept the impossible dream of the Motown sound alive when it seemed as if it had come to an end. The King of Pop, as he became known, was tall, thin and, in later years, pale. He was a self-confessed shut-in, who had a $1m-a-month pill habit and was addicted to plastic surgery. Among his many able imitators was the rapper Snoop Dogg, his former neighbour in the Los Angeles mansion where he died. But Jackson was not just a performer. Like Elvis before him, he was also a trendsetter. He blazed a trail for the modern music video, paving the way for today's MTV stars. Like Elvis, too, he was a man who was never quite at ease in his own skin. He was a black man who wanted to be white, a child who wanted to be an adult, and an adult who wanted to be a child. He was the most famous black man in the world, but he never felt at home in the black community. He performed for presidents and popes, yet he felt like an outsider. He was a consummate performer, yet he baulked at the idea of performing in public. Jackson was born in Gary, Indiana, and was the seventh of nine children. His admiration for Elvis Presley was apparent from the age of five, and he would later say that he had wanted to be a performer since he was \"a little boy with an orange juice box\". He was a child star, performing with his brothers in the Jackson Five, and he was only 11 when he sang the vocals on a song called Little Bitty Pretty One. He labelled Charles Manson a \"sick genius\" after the serial killer sent him a fawning letter. He was accused of child molestation in 1993 by a 13-year-old boy, Jordan Chandler, and the case was settled out of court for $", "decoding_steps": [312], "new_tokens": [514], "wall_time": [19.16867995262146], "accept_lengths": [2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2], "acceptance_rate": 0.5787965616045845}], "tstamp": 1736455508.6205804}

The volcano has been active for the past four years, but the more recent activity is some of the most intense since an eruption in 1992. The 1992 eruption lasted for several weeks and produced ash clouds that reached 60,000 feet in the air. In 2009, the volcano erupted for just a few hours, according to U.S. Geological Survey.

The little girl died after being flung at a wall by her father, Meyrick Fowler, then 24, who flew into a rage when his lottery number's didn't come up at their home in Ipswich, Suffolk. He was convicted of\u00a0her manslaughter and jailed for four years after throwing her so violently she suffered brain damage and four skull fractures when her crying disturbed his number checking ritual. Andrea's body was returned to Ms French fully-clothed and a funeral was held shortly after the tragic death in April 1999. But police failed to tell Ms French she was burying her daughter with much of her body parts missing. It was only two years after a national police audit in 2010 that she received a letter informing her that Andrea's vital organs were held in\u00a0a fridge at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. Her liver, spine, bowel, lungs, kidneys, heart, spleen, thymus, stomach, pancreas, trachea and skull fragments had all been retained without Ms French's consent. She received a further blow this month when police admitted that her brain had been cremated in 2009, after it had been sent to a hospital in Sheffield for examination, without their knowledge. The organs were stored as police investigated Andrea's death and kept in case Fowler appealed his sentence. Ms French said: 'After the funeral I felt I could try and move on. But now I feel lied to by everybody. I feel conned by the authorities, they have kept this secret from me for all these years.

'The most terrifying experience was the ceiling falling in the bedroom where we used to sleep. It collapsed where our bed used to be. We weren't in room at time thankfully.' For six months, the family were forced to live in one room of the house as they couldn't afford to get the problems fixed straight away, having already shelled out to the cowboy builders who left them in the lurch. Phillip, a civil servant, said: 'The house was crumbling around us, we had to turn off the lights as water was getting into electricity, it was that time of year when it was getting dark at 4pm, it was miserable.

According to a new Wall Street Journal - Nielsen online survey, 47% of Chinese Internet users are online at least once a day, compared to just 32% of Americans. Among the 55 countries surveyed, China, India, Brazil and the United States are the only countries that have Internet penetration rates above 30%. The survey also found that the average Chinese Internet user regularly visits 18 websites, compared to 13 for Americans. That's not a huge difference, but it's a nice reminder of how much bigger China is than the United States. There are nearly 10 times as many Chinese Internet users as Americans. And while some of that is due to the fact that China has a younger population overall, the survey found that Chinese Internet users are more likely to be in the 18-24 age group than Americans. According to the International Telecommunication Union, China has the world's largest number of Internet users, with just over 400 million. The U.S. is second with 240 million.

As so-called short waves collide near the surface they create weak microseismic waves, which combine with long, more powerful waves dragging across the ocean's floor to create the constant hum.

Earthquakes shake the planet in such a way that the Earth can oscillate for months after the seismic event.

In the late 1990s, however, seismologists found that the planet doesn't just oscillate following quakes, and instead is vibrating at extremely low frequencies all of the time.

The State Department has restricted travel by U.S. government employees to North Korea. The cyber attack on Sony Pictures has been a major source of tension between the United States and North Korea.

The faction behind the attack, called the Guardians of Peace, have threatened to attack theaters screening the film. The opening of the movie has been moved up from Christmas Day to December 25.

The rare fungus, Ophiocordyceps unilateralis, is without doubt one of the world's most bizarre and terrifying parasites. It's a fungus that can take over the body of a living insect, forcing it to climb to the top of a blade of grass and die, before the fungus bursts out of its head in a bid to spread its spores.

It was found to be responsible for a 50 per cent reduction in bee populations in the Pennsylvania area.

The case was brought by the state of Texas, which had asked the high court to overturn a lower court ruling that struck down its voter ID law. Texas argued the law was necessary to prevent voter fraud. Critics of the law said it was an attempt to suppress turnout among demographic groups that tend to vote Democratic, including minorities and college students. The Supreme Court's decision not to hear the case means the lower court ruling stands. The case was expected to be decided by June 2016, in the middle of the heat of next year's presidential election.\n1.CNN CBS ABC NBC FOX News\n2.CNN CBS ABC NBC FOX News News\n3.CNN CBS ABC NBC FOX News News 2015-04-27\n4.CNN CBS ABC NBC FOX News News2015-04-27\n5.CNN CBS ABC NBC FOX News News2015-04-272\n6.CNN CBS ABC NBC FOX News News2015-04-272015-04-27\n7.CNN CBS ABC NBC FOX News News 2", "decoding_steps": [207], "new_tokens": [514], "wall_time": [16.086181640625], "accept_lengths": [3, 1, 2, 4, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 4, 3, 4, 1, 2, 2, 2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 3, 11, 3, 8, 4, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 26, 3, 8, 2, 1, 5, 4, 19, 3, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 5, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 7, 2, 3, 6, 3, 2, 7, 8, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 7, 8, 3, 4, 6, 3, 2, 7, 2], "acceptance_rate": 0.7994791666666666}], "tstamp": 1736455949.7279923}

The process of cloud seeding was first proposed in the 1940s at the General Electric labs in Schenectady, New York. Two decades later, the Central Arizona Project and the Salt River Project invested in research to make it a reality. 'It hasn't been taken off the table as a potential tool as we work our way through drought now and in the future,' Nancy Selover, Arizona's state climatologist told Becky Brisley at Cronkite News. Since 2007, CAP has put about $1 million toward research happening in other states to increase the supply of water in the Colorado River system. Water in the air, even in dry areas, can be transformed into ice crystals by using planes to seed the atmosphere with chemicals such as silver iodide or dry ice . If it seems like it never stops raining, blame the Russians. Or even the North Koreans. CIA chiefs fear hostile nations are trying to manipulate the world's weather, a conference heard in February. A leading academic told how he got a mysterious phone call asking whether foreign countries could be triggering droughts or flooding. Professor Alan Robock, from Rutgers University in New Jersey, said: 'Consultants working for the CIA rang and said we'd like to know if someone is controlling the world's climate would we know about it? 'Of course they were also asking - if we control someone else's climate would they then know about it.' The professor is one of many scientists from around the world are actively looking at manipulating the weather as a way of combating climate change. Professor Robock told the callers that any attempts to meddle with the weather on a large scale would be detectable. The system works on the premise that rainfall takes place when supercooled droplets of water form ice crystals. As a result they become too heavy to remain suspended in the air, and fall, often melting on their way down to form rain. Water in the air, even in dry areas, can be transformed into ice crystals by seeding the atmosphere with chemicals such as silver iodide or dry ice.

The potential return of Richards, whose 13-4 record last season earned him consideration for the AL Cy Young Award, would be an enormous boost to the Angels.

Photo was taken at Murphy's Hole which is the same location 13-year-old Doreen O'Sullivan drowned in 1915 . Was it Doreen O'Sullivan' ghost? Ms Davison claims her daughter's leg was grabbed by something in the water . The image appeared to show two women and four children swimming at Murphy's Hole in the Lockyer River, south-east Queensland.

It provoked fierce discussion online after it was revealed a little girl had died in the watering hole a century prior. A Brisbane Courier newspaper clipping from November 22 1913 included a death notice for a little girl who died in that watering hole. 'Doreen O Sullivan, aged 13 years, eldest daughter of Mr. James O'Sullivan was accidentally drowned whilst bathing in the Lockyer Creek on Friday afternoon,' the notice read.

From Friday to Monday, a total of 8,480 migrants were rescued, according to the Italian coast guard, which said it received on Monday -- alone -- SOS calls from 20 boats in distress. On Tuesday, a spokesman with Save the Children told CNN the group fears 400 migrants could be missing, citing testimony from survivors who said their ship carrying 550 people capsized in the Mediterranean Sea about 80 miles off the Libyan coast. The Italian coast guard, however, told CNN that while it is taking the report seriously, it cannot confirm such an incident and has not yet found evidence at sea to indicate a migrant boat carrying approximately 550 has capsized with 145 rescued. An operation that included boats and planes did not find any survivors, nor bodies, nor any evidence to indicate a particular boat capsized, Coast Guard official Filippo Marini said. There has been a recent upsurge in migrant boats crossing the Mediterranean into Italy and an increase in rescues performed by the Italian Coast Guard to aid migrant boats. Why migrants are dying trying to reach Italy . According to the International Organization for Migration, Italy registered more than 10,000 migrants arriving in the first three months of 2015, and about 2,000 were rescued at sea during the first weekend of April in the Channel of Sicily. Most migrants recorded this year come from countries in West Africa as well as Somalia and Syria, the IOM said. They use Libya as a country of transit. At least 480 migrants have died while crossing the Mediterranean since the beginning of the year, often because of bad weather and overcrowded vessels used by smugglers, the IOM said. Sometimes the captains and crews abandon the ships, leaving passengers to fend for themselves. Last week: 978 migrants rescued in one day in Mediterranean Sea .

The asteroid is currently about 1.5 million miles from Earth. A giant asteroid is hurtling toward Earth. But fear not, it's not coming close enough to hit us -- at least not for the next 100 years. That's the calculated time frame for when the space rock, named 2014 HQ124, will make its closest approach to Earth. And even then it will be at a safe distance of about 13 million miles, or 53 times the distance between Earth and the moon. The massive asteroid was first discovered on April 23 by the University of Hawaii's Pan-STARRS 1 telescope on Haleakala, Hawaii. It was later observed by astronomers using the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. That's when it was determined that the asteroid was forging a path toward Earth. Now, the space rock is on a trajectory that will bring it within 1.5 million miles of Earth on May 15. However, the asteroid will not impact Earth. \"There is no chance of an impact anywhere on Earth,\" said Patrick Paolucci, a research scientist at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California. \"The closest approach to Earth will be about 13 million miles, which is 53 times the distance between Earth and the moon.\" Paolucci, who is a member of the Arecibo Observatory's asteroid radar facility, said the space rock will be visible to astronomers for the next 12 days or so. He said the Arecibo Observatory will further track the space rock's path. \"We think it's a pretty big asteroid,\" he said. \"It's about 400 meters in diameter, which is about a quarter of a mile.\" Paolucci said that while it's not going to hit Earth, the passage of the asteroid is still a big deal. \"This is significant because we're going to spend the next 12 days or so tracking this asteroid,\" he said", "decoding_steps": [274], "new_tokens": [514], "wall_time": [18.563188791275024], "accept_lengths": [7, 3, 1, 9, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 6, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 10, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 2, 1, 3, 4, 4, 1, 4, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2], "acceptance_rate": 0.6282722513089005}], "tstamp": 1736456150.5035443}
