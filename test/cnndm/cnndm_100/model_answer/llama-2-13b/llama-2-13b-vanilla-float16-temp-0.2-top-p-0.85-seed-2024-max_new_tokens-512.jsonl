The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, has condemned certain welfare reforms as part of  a series of interventions by church leaders raising concerns about the shape of the economy. In his video message the Prime Minister, who has defended the right of the Church to intervene in political debate, said Easter was ' time to reflect on the part that Christianity plays in our national life'. 'The Church is not just a collection of beautiful old buildings;  it is a living, active force doing great works across our country,' he said. 'When people are homeless, the Church is there with hot meals and shelter.  When people are addicted or in debt; when people are suffering, or grieving - the Church is there.' 'Across Britain, Christians don't just talk about 'loving thy neighbour', they live it out ...  in faith schools, in prisons, in community groups. 'And it's for all these reasons that we should feel proud to say: this is a Christian country.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic has had his four-game ban reduced by one match after successfully appealing . Ibrahimovic was heard swearing as he walked towards the changing room after PSG's loss against Bordeaux . The Swede reacted angrily to the defeat and said it was the worst refereeing display he'd ever seen . He was angered by suggestions his remarks were also derogatory to France as a whole and claimed his words had been 'twisted'. Speaking in the video in English but in partial sentences, the Sweden international could be heard saying: 'He's an a******. Play 15 years, never seen referee this s*** country. Don't even deserve PSG should be in this country. F****** too good for all of you. Should be happy they exist.' Marseille playmaker Payet then received a two-game sanction after aiming expletives at the closed door of the match officials' dressing room following the goalless draw with Lyon, in which Lucas Ocampos' late strike was deemed not to have crossed the goal-line. A statement from OM read: 'Olympique de Marseille received on Friday an official notification that the (LFP) has accepted the proposal of the CNOSF concerning the suspension of Dimitri Payet. 'The (CNOSF) arbitrator proposed to reduce the suspension from two matches to one match with a further one-match ban suspended.' PSG initially only reported the news in a post on their Swedish Twitter account. It read: 'Now it is clear. Ibrahimovic's penalty has been shortened by one game! He will be back", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [16.74104332923889], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1736405807.8958554}
{"model_id": "llama-2-13b", "choices": [{"turns": "A suicide bomber on a motorbike blew himself up in front of the Kabul Bank in Jalalabad early Saturday, a local government spokesman said. The ISIS terrorist group claimed responsibility for the attack. The explosion killed at least 33 people and injured more than 100 others, public health spokesman Najibullah Kamawal said. The claim appears to be the first in Afghanistan by ISIS, CNN's Nick Paton Walsh said. It was made by an offshoot called ISIS Wilayat Khorasan. In a statement, the group said the bomber was named Abu Mohammad and he belonged to their ranks. He was targeting government workers collecting their pay at the bank, the terrorists said. He detonated his charge at the peak of rush hour on the first day of the week, when the bank would be expected to be crowded. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid, in a text message to journalists, distanced his group from the attack. \"The explosion in Jalalabad doesn't have anything to do with us and we condemn it,\" he said. ISIS refers to Afghanistan and Pakistan as the province of \"Khorasan.\" In March, CNN reported on ISIS recruiting in Afghanistan. The United Nations condemned the violence. \"The continuing use of suicide attacks in densely populated areas, that are certain to kill and maim large numbers of Afghan civilians, may amount to a war crime,\" said Nicholas Haysom, head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. The United Nations said that in the first three months of the year 655 people were killed and 1,155 were wounded in suicide attacks throughout the country. Fears about ISIS involvement in the region have been growing this year. In February, Mullah Abdul Rauf, a former Taliban commander who had become a recruiter for ISIS in Afghanistan, was killed in a drone strike, according to officials who spoke to CNN. And later that same week, Gen. John Campbell, the top U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that he was concerned about the growth of ISIS in the area. \"You do have some of the Taliban breaking", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [16.39301586151123], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1736405824.3614066}

Brelo is the lone officer among the 13 who fired their weapons that night who is charged criminally because prosecutors say he stood on the hood and opened fire four seconds after the other officers had stopped shooting . Brelo's attorney Patrick D'Angelo conceded that his tactics could be called into question given that Brelo exposed himself to danger when he stepped onto the hood of a beat-up Chevy Malibu to fire 15 rounds into the windshield of the suspects' vehicle . But Brelo and 12 officers who shot a total of 137 rounds into the car in November 2012 had ample reason to believe that Russell and Williams were shooting at them, he said . Brelo's defense team has argued that all 49 rounds Brelo fired that night, including the last 15, were lawful . The threat from the pair didn't end until Brelo reached into the Malibu and removed the keys to prevent the suspects from using the car as a weapon, according to his defense . Russell and Williams were each shot more than 20 times . The chase started with a failed traffic stop on the edge of downtown by a plainclothes detective who never reported to dispatchers that he'd lost sight of the vehicle . Russell then sped past Cleveland police headquarters, where his car backfired . Officers and witnesses standing outside were certain they'd heard gunshots and a police radio call for shots fired triggered an adrenaline-fueled rush by officers to join the chase . Brelo and his partner were two of the first officers to join the pursuit that ultimately included more than 60 police cars, 104 officers and reached at least 100mph . After driving into a school parking lot more than 20 minutes after the chase began, Russell turned the car around and tried to flee again - sideswiping a cruiser before coming to a stop .

China's pollution hit cities are now having to cope with a fresh nuisance after the fourth massive sandstorm struck the north-west of the country this year alone. The images show the city of Golmud, in the country's north west Qinghai Province, as it succumbs to a sweeping half-hour sandstorm which reduced the visibility to as little as 30 metres, according to\u00a0The People's Daily Online. The raging sand storm sweeps in on the city of Golmud in north west China, where 200,000 people live . The sandstorm was the fourth to hit the area this year as authorities struggle to deal with the natural hazards . China's Meteorlogical Centre issued a blue alert as the sandstorms swept across the north of the country . China's National Meteorological Centre (NMC) has now issued a blue alert for the latest sandstorms to hit the northern regions. The red sand swept across the northern part of the country bringing strong winds and floating sand to the regions of Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Ningxia and Shaanxi, in what was the fourth sandstorm to hit the area this year. The organisation advised residents to stay indoors and local authorities to brace for the clean-up operation after the sandstorms. China's four-tier colour-coded weather warning system signifies red as the most severe followed by orange, yellow and blue. Photos of the city of Dunhuang in the north-western province of Gansu show the thick orange haze coating the city's atmosphere and the lack of people on the streets gave the area an almost alien planet appearance. A local meteorologist said visibility was reduced to less than 50metres in downtown areas. Police spokesman Hui Chuang said: 'The storm forced most people to stay indoors because it was difficult to drive anyway given the low visibility and also hard to breathe without inhaling sand.

Broga celebrates the physical over the spiritual, and strength over flexibility. Experts say it sets men free to flex tight hamstrings without hearing invocations to Hindu deities or feeling inept next to a woman twisted like a pretzel. Scroll down for video Yoga for men: From downward dog to warrior pose, Broga is becoming increasingly popular thanks to its 'rugged' approach to traditional yoga workouts Making a point: Traditionally seen as an exercise regime for women, yoga is changing and now has a more universal appeal 'I consider myself an athletic guy, but have never been flexible and didn't like the thought of embarrassing myself in front of a group of women,' said financial analyst and Broga enthusiast Eric Wright, 22, from San Jose, California. Founder: Robert Sidoti (pictured) is the creator and co-Founder of Broga Eric and his male colleagues use the video streaming service Grokker, which is aimed at broadcasting fitness, food and yoga classes directly to your home or office, to partake in their weekly yoga sessions. 'On Wednesdays we have a standing Broga appointment and anywhere from five to eight others will join me,' he said. Grokker founder and CEO Lorna Borenstein said more men are adding yoga to their exercise routines as a cross-training tool for flexibility and improving recovery time. Even if they spend most of their time focusing on more high intensity gym training, men are now using yoga as a useful warm-up method. 'Men are a little late to the party,' she said. 'But we're seeing more men in the workplace who find time to do yoga together a few times a week.' Yoga instructor Robert Sidoti, based in Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, is the creator and co-founder of the trademarked Broga Yoga, which so far has trained some 200 Broga instructors in at least 22 states.

The notice read: 'To the person going through our trash for their next meal, you're a human being and worth more than a meal from a dumpster. 'Please come in during operating hours for a classic Pb&j [peanut butter and jam sandwich], fresh veggies, and a cup of water at no charge. No questions asked.' A customer called Greg King noticed the message and posted a picture of it on his Instagram page with the hashtag #thatswhatlovelookslike - within a couple of days it had been shared thousands of times on social media. The owner told News Channel 4 that she hadn't expected it to receive such a huge response and was just trying to do the right thing. She said: 'Last week, I had noticed some bags, when I had taken out the trash, were torn open and some of the food was taken out,' 'That really, it hurt me that someone had to do that - I will not take down that sign until they come in. 'I think we've all been in that position where we needed someone's help and we just needed someone to extend that hand and if I can be that one person to extend that hand to another human being then I will definitely do it.' Thousands of people have since taken to social media to rave about Ashley's actions. Facebook user Lesley Jaquay wrote: 'Imagine if every restaurant did this. So much food goes to waste. Good job PB Jams! would love to donate a few meals.' Another called Brittany Hueter wrote: 'I wish there were more business owners like you. These places that have a heart are where I like to spend my money at.' Ashley Jiron, owner of P.B. Jams in Warr Acres, Oklahoma .

'My car was just sitting there on this little island on its own,' she said. 'It was pretty surreal. I feel pretty lucky today.' In Aurora, near Denver, one person died after being thrown from an Oldsmobile Bravada that lost control and rolled on an icy stretch of Interstate 225, striking a passing public bus. The only person on the bus was its driver, who wasn't hurt. Another person in the Oldsmobile was taken to a hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening, police said. Near Fort Carson, the Colorado State Patrol responded to a series of rush-hour crashes involving a total of nearly 20 cars. In the mountains, Interstate 70 was temporarily closed after several trucks spun out on snowy Vail Pass. At lower elevations, the storm left only light snow on grass, and roads were largely clear because of recent warm weather. However, motorists driving at normal speeds were surprised by icy patches, especially on bridges, said Trooper James Schmidt of the Colorado State Patrol. 'We're in Colorado.

{"model_id": "llama-2-13b", "choices": [{"turns": "Wilfried Zaha has admitted he felt 'worthless' during his two-year spell as a Manchester United player after his dream move to Old Trafford turned sour. The 22-year-old winger was signed by then Old Trafford boss Sir Alex Ferguson in January 2013 from Crystal Palace for \u00a310million. But the terms of the transfer saw him loaned straight back to the Eagles for the remainder of the season and he did not arrive at Old Trafford until the summer, by which time Ferguson had retired and been replaced by David Moyes. During a disastrous campaign for the club under Moyes, Zaha made just four United appearances before playing out the second half of last season at Cardiff. 'There is nothing worse than not being involved,' he told the Daily Telegraph. 'You are sitting there thinking 'what exactly am I? A footballer who is not playing football?' You feel a bit worthless sitting in the stands, watching all the time. You have nothing to speak about with the players. Zaha made just four appearances for Manchester United in two years with the club . 'If you have played the game then it's \"well done\" or \"you should have passed here or there\". But when you haven't played... I think people lose a bit of respect for you. I think they are thinking 'well, he's not played'. They don't have anything to speak to you about. It's a big thing.' 'There were so many rumours about me that were not true. And they hurt me because all I was doing was keeping my head down to do my best every time and then after training I'd go home and there would be something in the paper or wherever about me not having a good attitude and that's why I wasn't playing, rumours about my private life and that's why I wasn't playing, me turning up late for this, turning up late for that.'

Andrew Caldwell, 21, was covered in the dessert after he was recognized by a cashier at a St. Louis FroYo store. He said the woman called him a gay slur, said that it was impossible for God to 'turn' gay people straight, and then picked up the extra large bowl from the scale at the counter and aggressively threw it in Caldwell's face. However the employee, Stephanie Diaz, says Caldwell is a liar. In an interview with the same TV station, Diaz said Caldwell demanded a discount for his yogurt. When she didn't relent, he called her a 'dog' and a 'b----', Diaz said. Diaz, who is openly gay, said it had nothing to do with the viral video. 'I threw the ice cream at him,' she said outside of the store Thursday. 'He called me a dog. \u2026 I lost it.' 'I lost it': Stephanie Diaz, who is openly gay, admits to throwing the yogurt at Caldwell, but said he is lying about his story . Scene: The incident occurred Wednesday at his FroYo store in Delmar, St.Louis . Comfortably straight: Andrew Caldwell, seen here in a recent photo from his Facebook page, happily announced last year that God had cured his homosexuality and that he had been 'delivered' CCTV footage released of the incident shows Caldwell throwing money at Diaz. That is when Diaz throws the yogurt. The FroYo store released the footage to show Caldwell was lying. Diaz said she had never seen the church video or heard of Caldwell.

Trinity Culley, from Fingringhoe, Essex, used the knowledge she gained from watching the baby-birthing programme which she secretly viewed in her bedroom after her mother told her it was too graphic. But when her mother Dee Culley's waters broke two weeks ahead of schedule, she sprang into action. Trinity Culley (second from left), pictured with her mother Dee and siblings Samuel (left), Jade (right) and Jasmin Elizabeth-Rose, who she delivered when her mother went into labour two weeks early . Whilst her dad Terry, 34, was on the phone desperately trying to arrange for a lift to hospital Trinity calmly collected towels and reassured her mum everything would be okay. Within minutes she had helped deliver her baby sister, Jasmin Elizabeth-Rose, who arrived in the family's front room weighing 7lb 1oz. Mrs Culley\u00a0said: 'My waters had broken and my husband was on the phone to get his mum to take us to hospital. 'But by the time she got here, the baby had already been born. 'When it all started happening, Trinity turned to me and said: \"It's OK mum, I have seen One Born Every Minute. I'll go get the towels.\" 'She was just amazing. Words can't express how proud I am of her. I think a lot girls of her age would not have been so calm and known what to do.'

Adebayor has one year left to run on his current contract at White Hart Lane, but his inconsistent form has led to few assurances over his future. Maverick Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor performs a strange dance in front of the Arc de Triomphe . The Togo international posted the video of him dancing in front of the Paris landmark on his Instagram account . He joined Spurs in 2011 from Manchester City, initially on loan before an impressive first season tally of 18 goals, convinced the club to make the switch permanent for \u00a35million the following summer. Since then, however, Adebayor's goal return has become significantly more modest and he has not scored in the league for Spurs since the 2-1 defeat to Newcastle back in October. Factor in the remarkable rise of academy graduate Harry Kane and it is easy to see why some sections of supporters have written Adebayor off as surplus to requirements. Adebayor has only one year left to run on his current contract at Tottenham and could leave this summer .

Italian Alex Bellini is to be subjected to the full force of the iceberg as it melts, cracks and even flips - while hopefully staying safe inside his small spherical cabin. The aim of the cabin fever-inducing stunt is to highlight how global warming will melt icebergs around the world and cause sea levels to rise. Scroll down for video . Italian Alex Bellini will live atop an iceberg in Greenland starting next year. He will live inside a contained ball (artist's illustration shown), with no means to escape for 12 months. The capsule will be 10ft (three metres) wide and could fit 10 people - but Mr Bellini will remove all of the seats apart from one, for himself . Mr Bellini, 36, is seeking funding for his project, called Adrift, which he hopes to begin in November 2016. Previous feats by the explorer include running more than 14,000 miles (22,500km), rowing more than 21,000 miles (34,000km) and spending 560 days in isolation. He has rowed both the Atlantic and Pacific and insists he favours challenges where there is a perceived lack of control. The capsules, initially designed essentially as escape pods for areas at risk of tsunami, can hold from two to ten people and range in price from \u00a38,000 to \u00a313,500 ($12,000 to $20,000). Four are currently in use in Japan, while two are in the US. Mr Bellini will use one at the upper scale, 10ft (three metres) wide - although he\u2019ll remove all the seats except one for himself. Inside he\u2019ll have exercise equipment, such as a stationary bike, in addition to supplies for the year such as food and water. But his latest venture represents a whole new challenge as he will have to deal with intense isolation and undergo serious psychological tests as he copes with being alone for 12 months.

The splatters of blood on the checklist for the very first US spacewalk were from an astronaut as he frantically battled to close the hatch door of the spacecraft after a historic venture. But the Gemini 4 mission of June 1965 ultimately proved successfully, and paved the way to astronauts walking on the moon for the first time four years later. A complete 13-page checklist, including a bloodstained document seen at the front), from the Gemini 4 mission in June 1965 is tipped to sell for a huge \u00a380,000 ($120,000). The list shows the various steps the astronauts had to go through when opening and closing the hatch to space . Gemini 4 launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on 3 June 1965 with two astronauts on board. One, Ed White, was tasked with performing the first US spacewalk, less than three months after Soviet Alexey Leonov had completed the first spacewalk in history. The two astronauts on the Gemini 4 mission were Jim McDivitt and Ed White. The Gemini programme of the 1960s was designed to develop and test capabilities that would ultimately land humans on the moon in the Apollo missions. The first crewed Gemini flight, Gemini 3, lifted off Launch Pad 19 at Cape Canaveral in Florida on March 23, 1965. Nasa's two-man Gemini spaceflights demonstrated that astronauts could change their capsule's orbit, remain in space for at least two weeks and work outside their spacecraft. They also pioneered rendezvous and docking with other spacecraft. All were essential skills to land on the moon and return safely to Earth. They orbited Earth 66 times over four days and, on the first day, Ed White donned a spacesuit and drifted out of the cramped capsule. He spent 20 minutes in space on the spacewalk, or extravehicular activity", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [17.900437593460083], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1736406299.3604088}

The damage was just part of the destruction caused by cowboy builders who had been called in to fix a leak in the Beckle-Raymond's three bedroom property in North London. Instead, they left Phillip, his wife Gaby and their two young children, Orion and Aurielle, in an unsafe building with no roof while they ran off with \u00a317,000 of their money. Scroll down for video . Phillip and Gaby outside their London home which was left a wreck thanks to cowboy builders . 'When the builders walked out, we only had tarpaulin protecting the house throughout winter,' Gaby explains on Channel 5 show Britain's Horror Homes. 'When it rained, water started coming in, it was raining inside our house. The box room caved in, the bathroom became bowed, the ceiling will fall in the children's room. 'The most terrifying experience was the ceiling falling in the bedroom where we used to sleep. It collapsed where our bed used to be. We weren't in room at time thankfully.' For six months, the family were forced to live in one room of the house as they couldn't afford to get the problems fixed straight away, having already shelled out to the cowboy builders who left them in the lurch. Phillip, a civil servant, said: 'The house was crumbling around us, we had to turn off the lights as water was getting into electricity, it was that time of year when it was getting dark at 4pm, it was miserable. I hated leaving Gaby and the children like that when I had to go to work.' Phillip and Gaby had used all their savings to buy the property five years before for \u00a3325,000. The builders left the family with no roof and just\u00a0tarpaulin protecting the house from the winter elements. As a result, rain got into the property causing ceilings to collapse . The parents say they are devastated at being 'taken for a ride'. It will cost \u00a335,000 to repair their home . As they started a family, they worked hard to turn the house into a happy and comfortable place to raise their children.

Experts say it's an extremely good investment .\nArticle: (CNN) -- The U.S. government has been secretly collecting the telephone records of millions of U.S. customers of Verizon under a top secret court order, according to a report in the Guardian newspaper. The order, issued in April by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, requires Verizon on an \"ongoing, daily basis\" to give the National Security Agency information on all telephone calls in its systems, both within the U.S. and between the U.S. and other countries. The court order was disclosed Wednesday by the Guardian, which said it was obtained from documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. The Guardian said the order requires Verizon to provide the NSA with \"metadata\" -- such as a list of numbers involved in a call -- but not the content of the call. The newspaper said the order does not allow the government to listen in or record calls, but it does allow the agency to discover who is talking to whom. The Guardian said the order does not apply to Verizon's newFiOS service, which it said is not yet available to the majority of the company's customers. The newspaper said the order was granted under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which requires the government to obtain a warrant from the secret court to conduct surveillance. The Guardian said the order was granted on April 25 and is good until July 19.

Jack Rivera, a New York trucker, captured the collision on his dashcam as he drove along the Interstate 35E in Texas last Wednesday. Footage shows the driver of a black SUV, identified as 49-year-old Laura Michelle Mayeaux, coming off at the 397 exit and veering over to the wrong side of the lane. She then steers head-on into a truck which rolls over on its side with debris flying everywhere. As the back end of the 18-wheeler swings out, it pushes a red pickup truck off course. Thick black skid marks can be seen on the tarmac as smoke fills the air. Rivera told\u00a0waxahachietx.com\u00a0that once things came to a standstill he got out of his vehicle to see if he could offer any assistance to the parties involved before authorities arrived. The incident, which occurred just past 6pm, shut the highway for around two hours.

The Guardian said the order, issued by the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, requires Verizon on an \"ongoing, daily basis\" to give the National Security Agency information on all telephone calls in its systems, both within the U.S. and between the U.S. and other countries.

A student who tried to cheat his way to a better degree by hacking into the university computers and changing his marks has been jailed. Imran Uddin, 25, who was studying science, bought keyboard spying equipment on the internet which he then connected to a number of university computers. Through the software, which recorded key strokes, he was able to find out the passwords that staff were typing in to log in to the computers. He then used those passwords to log on to their accounts himself. After hacking into the university computer system, Uddin changed the marks that he had been given for previous assessments. On one paper, he upped his mark from 57 per cent, a lower second grade, to 73 per cent, a first. He carried out his plot using keyboard \u2018shadowing\u2019 devices which look like a USB stick and can be bought for as little as \u00a349 on the internet. He plugged these into the back of a number of staff computers at the University of Birmingham where he was studying. The device records everything which is typed into the keyboard and saves the data. Uddin, from Birmingham, was in his final year of a bio-science course. At the time of the hacking he was expected to achieve a 2:2 degree. He was jailed for four months at Birmingham Crown Court on Thursday after admitting six charges which were in breach of the Computer Misuse Act. Sentencing him, Judge James Burbridge said it was unclear why Uddin had tried to change his grades. Judge Burbridge said: \u2018For reasons not entirely clear to me, whether it was monetary, or pride, or a desire to outperform others, you decided to cheat and you formed a settled intention to do that. I consider your actions were planned and persistent.\u2019 He warned that Uddin\u2019s behaviour could have undermined public confidence in the degree system.

And when it comes to mating, this family of frogs has a unique trait not seen in other frogs. They typically like to live near fast streams and, if a pair decides to mate, they will spend five minutes searching for a private spot. \u2018The male quickly carves out a chamber by excavating the sand around small rocks at the bottom of the stream,\u2019 said Agata Blaszczak-Boxe from New Scientist. \u2018Then, like Christian Grey from Fifty Shades he invites his mate into his sex dungeon, which is only just big enough to fit the two amorous amphibians.\u2019 The amphibian, part of the Hylodes lateristrigatus group, is characterised by light stripes on its size, while it is also relatively small, according to the researchers. It was found in the Atlantic forest of Serra do Japi in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil . Once the female has laid her eggs, the male then covers up the entrance with sand from the stream. The reason for this is not only to protect the eggs from predators, but also from tadpoles of the species - as they are known to be cannibalistic. Finding the frogs wasn\u2019t easy, either - they are so secretive that the researchers had to don camouflage gear in order to observe them. A new species of glass frog (shown right) has been discovered with translucent skin so you can see its insides. The creature, named Hyalinobatrachium dianae, was found in the mountains of eastern Costa Rica and has a distinctive call.

That treble was Ronaldo's 31st career hat-trick and his 24th in La Liga, equalling Lionel Messi's record in the competition. It also took his formidable goal tally for the Bernabeu club to 299 in 287 matches. Against Granada, Ronaldo has now scored 11 times in just eight matches. But, compared with some, they have got off quite lightly. We take a look at the clubs who have suffered the most at the hands of the Portuguese wonder. Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals as Real Madrid thrashed Granada 9-1 on Sunday afternoon . The Portuguese superstar was simply irresistible as Real ran riot at the Bernabeu . SEVILLA - 18 Goals in 12 matches . There's no denying it - Ronaldo just loves playing against Sevilla, whose defence must be terrified every time they see him. Three of those La Liga hat-tricks have come against the team from Andalusia - he scored triples in a 6-2 win at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan in May 2011, a 4-1 success at the Bernabeu in February 2013 and a 7-3 thrashing in October of the same year. But they aren't even Ronaldo's best return. He scored four goals, including a 12-minute hat-trick, in another 6-2 win in Seville back in May 2011. Most recently, Ronaldo scored twice in Real's 2-0 UEFA Super Cup win over Sevilla in August.

Zinedine Zidane (with Odegaard behind him, right) dropped the Norwegian from the Castilla side this month . The young midfielder was clearly in awe of the former World Cup winning striker and simply wrote 'legend' alongside the picture on Instagram. Ronaldo, who scored more than 100 goals for Real and netted an impressive 62 international goals, was visiting his old club ahead of their Champions League quarter-final second-leg clash against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday. Odegaard opted to join Real Madrid after courting interest from a host of top clubs in Europe, including Manchester United and Liverpool, and signed a long-term \u00a340,000 a week contract with the Champions League winners in January. The former Stromgodset playmaker has trained with Carlo Ancelotti's first team regularly since his arrival, rubbing shoulder's with the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale. Odegaard is said to be on a different wave length to his Castilla team-mates because he rarely trains with them . The 16-year-old joined Real Madrid for \u00a32.3million in January signing a long-term \u00a340,000 a week contract . But the Norwegian wonderkid has found life tough at the Spanish giants in recent weeks. First team coach in waiting Zinedine Zidane dropped Odegaard from his Castilla side earlier this month after a dramatic downturn in results since his arrival. There have been suggestions that his presence in the side has riled team-mates that feel Odegaard training with the first team three times a week means he lacks cohesion in the B team. Real Madrid are desperate for the Castilla side to win promotion to the second tier of Spanish football and Zidane has to decide whether that goal is more attainable without the young talent.\nArticle: (CNN) -- A 16-year-old boy has been arrested in connection with the murder of a 17-year-old girl in the English city of Leicester, police said", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [16.375441551208496], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1736406613.8883123}

Such was the severity of her eating disorder, that the 15-year-old was admitted to hospital twice and faced rigorous counselling sessions. Today, Emma, whose decision to release the photos is supported by her mother Kim Waddington, said she wants to help other anorexia sufferers. By combating the compulsion to be skinny - and instead focusing on getting fit and building her muscle definition - she is now a healthier eight stone. Emma's mother Kim, left, said it was devastating watching her daughter face her 'horrific' ordeal . 'I wouldn't want anyone to go through what I went through,' Emma said. 'I went through hell. 'I've realised I was miserable when I'd lost weight. 'But I've learned so much from what I've been through and if my story can even help one person beat anorexia, I would be so happy. 'I'm 10 times stronger than I've ever been before.' Ms Waddington described watching her daughter battle the eating disorder as a 'horrific' ordeal. 'I felt so out of control and every day is a battle. I woke up thinking about it and would go to bed thinking about it,' she said. 'It's a monster that had taken over my daughter and we were fighting that monster every day. It was horrific watching my daughter go through it all.' Emma, from Blaby, Leicestershire, first felt the urge to lose weight after seeing pictures of celebrities in magazines. Quickly, she said, it became an obsession. She said: 'Whoever was on the front cover, I wanted to be like them. 'I became very depressed about the way I looked because I wasn't as skinny as them, I didn't want to look in the mirror anymore.' Within weeks her weight had plummeted to eight stone, but she was compelled to shed more. 'I would go online about 100 times a day, obsessively trying to find new ways of losing weight,' she said.

Caught on camera: Police in Maryland are hunting for a 'heartless' thief (seen above on CCTV footage) who stole a four-year-old boy's wheelchair in the middle of the night. Distraught: The youngster's mother left the wheelchair in the lobby of their building on Merrimac Drive, Langley Park, as usual on Sunday evening since it's easier to carry her son to their second floor apartment . Prince George's County Police have released a piece of surveillance footage which shows a person pushing the empty chair in a parking lot. They're asking anyone with information about the case to contact investigators. The film appears to show a dark-haired white male dressed in a jacket and pants. A cash reward is being offered. Commenting on the incident, Capt. Ken Humbel said: 'This family already faces challenges and shouldn't be burdened with the emotional and financial stress of the theft of this wheelchair. Flashback: The boy's mother has shared a video of her son using his chair  in a bid to trigger tip offs . 'The suspect we\u2019re looking for has no heart.'

The boy's mother has also shared a video of her son using his chair with the community in a bid to trigger tip offs. While officers search for the suspect, they're in talks with a foundation that may help find a replacement chair in the meantime.

It predicted that numbers of deaths in Britain, which have been falling for 40 years, will start to go up and increase by 20 per cent over the next two decades. At the same time the price of a funeral is rising fast, thanks to higher costs for cremation, rising undertakers\u2019 bills as funeral firms are faced with bad debts, and the increasing fees demanded by churches. Deaths in Britain, which have been falling for 40 years, will start to go up and increase by 20 per cent over the next two decades, a report by a think tank has found (file photo) The report, prepared by an old age think tank, the International Longevity Centre-UK, and backed by insurance firm OneFamily, suggests that younger people who already feel financially hard pressed in comparison to their parents will still be under money pressure even after their deaths. Younger people are finding it increasingly difficult to afford homes or to start families, and in the long-term their pensions are much less secure than those of their parents, many of whom enjoyed the generous and fast-disappearing defined benefit pension system. The report from ILC-UK to be published next week said that death rates are set to go up following a long period in which medical advances, better diet, healthier lifestyles and the growing unpopularity of smoking, and the decline of dangerous heavy industrial jobs, have meant fewer people have been dying despite a rising population. \u2018After decades of the number of deaths in the UK falling, 2015 will mark a tipping point where the historic trend starts to reverse,\u2019 it said. \u2018As the oldest of the baby boomer generation move through their later years, deaths are predicted to rise by 20 per cent.\u2019 It added: \u2018This will have significant implications for current forecasts of funeral costs and highlights a growing need for families to broach the delicate subject of end of life expenses.\u2019 A 'simple' funeral", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [16.961975812911987], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1736406699.2228436}

He was wanted by Lincolnshire Police over an alleged domestic violence and assault. After fleeing his home, the 22-year-old goaded officers by sharing photographs online which showed him standing outside the force's headquarters. He was eventually arrested in November in a cafe after posing outside five different police stations over two weeks and was this week jailed for eight months. But after spending less than five months behind bars since his arrest, the 22-year-old has already been released. Last year Bee taunted officers by captioning photographs 'come catch me if you can' and bragging that he was 'always playing hide and seek'. He visited five different police stations without being apprehended and even flashing his genitals outside one. The father of one had been wanted by police for breaking a non-molestation order against his former girlfriend after showing up at her house in the middle of the night. Lincoln Crown Court heard how he had been 'threatening and abusive' towards the woman when he 'kicked her door down' last October. The father of one pictured outside Lincolnshire Police headquarters in November. He was eventually arrested in a cafe . Before his arrest Bee said he was taunting police 'as a bit of fun'. He was jailed yesterday for eight months but has been released after spending less than five months behind bars since being arrested . When police couldn't find him after the assault they released his mugshot to appeal for his whereabouts. In response, Bee took to Facebook to mock their efforts. Among pictures he shared online was one of a police officer standing in the street which he captioned 'is it me you're looking for'. He also posed outside Lincolnshire Police HQ, looking towards the camera and giving a thumbs up. In other posts he said the justice system 'is really f****d up' and bragged about buying a doughnut in Tesco without being caught. At the time, he said he was taunting police 'because it's funny.' He told reporters: 'It's really funny, I wanted to do it to show how ridiculous this all is and how they obviously aren't that bothered about me", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [16.915119171142578], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1736406716.1645513}

The information was used in a 2006 New York Times article about Operation Merlin, a CIA operation that was designed to disrupt Iran's nuclear program. The operation involved providing Iran with a flawed design for a nuclear weapon. The Justice Department said the information Sterling provided to the reporter was classified and that he was not authorized to disclose it. \"The unauthorized disclosure of classified information can have serious consequences for our national security,\" said U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia Neil MacBride. \"The Department of Justice will continue to investigate and prosecute those who violate their oaths and compromise our national security.\" The Justice Department said the investigation into Sterling began in 2003, when the CIA's Counterintelligence Center received information that a New York Times reporter was working on a story about Operation Merlin. The CIA launched an internal investigation and determined that Sterling was the source of the information. The Justice Department said Sterling was interviewed by the FBI in 2003 and 2004, but he denied providing the information to the reporter. The Justice Department said it was able to determine that Sterling was the source of the information after reviewing documents and conducting interviews. Sterling is the second former CIA employee to be charged with leaking classified information to the media. In 2010, former CIA officer John Kiriakou was charged with disclosing classified information to journalists. Kiriakou pleaded guilty to the charge and was", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [17.461572408676147], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1736406817.1353238}

The man was arrested in the Woolwich area of south London, where the soldier was killed on Wednesday, the Metropolitan Police said in a statement. The man was arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in custody. The soldier, who has not been named, was attacked by two men in a car and then hacked to death with a meat cleaver and knives in broad daylight. The attackers, who were filmed by a passer-by, were shot by police. The soldier was wearing a Help for Heroes T-shirt, a charity that supports wounded servicemen and women. The charity said it was \"deeply shocked and saddened\" by the attack. \"Our thoughts and prayers are with the soldier's family and friends at this very difficult time,\" it said in a statement. The attack has been condemned by British Prime Minister David Cameron, who called it a \"sickening\" and \"barbaric\" act. \"We will never buckle in the face of such violence,\" he said. \"We will never give in to terror or terrorism in any of its forms.\" The attack comes at a time of heightened tensions in Britain over the role of the military in Afghanistan.

From Friday to Monday, a total of 8,480 migrants were rescued, according to the Italian coast guard, which said it received on Monday -- alone -- SOS calls from 20 boats in distress. On Tuesday, a spokesman with Save the Children told CNN the group fears 400 migrants could be missing, citing testimony from survivors who said their ship carrying 550 people capsized in the Mediterranean Sea about 80 miles off the Libyan coast. The Italian coast guard, however, told CNN that while it is taking the report seriously, it cannot confirm such an incident and has not yet found evidence at sea to indicate a migrant boat carrying approximately 550 has capsized with 145 rescued. An operation that included boats and planes did not find any survivors, nor bodies, nor any evidence to indicate a particular boat capsized, Coast Guard official Filippo Marini said. There has been a recent upsurge in migrant boats crossing the Mediterranean into Italy and an increase in rescues performed by the Italian Coast Guard to aid migrant boats. Why migrants are dying trying to reach Italy . According to the International Organization for Migration, Italy registered more than 10,000 migrants arriving in the first three months of 2015, and about 2,000 were rescued at sea during the first weekend of April in the Channel of Sicily. Most migrants recorded this year come from countries in West Africa as well as Somalia and Syria, the IOM said. They use Libya as a country of transit. At least 480 migrants have died while crossing the Mediterranean since the beginning of the year, often because of bad weather and overcrowded vessels used by smugglers, the IOM said. Sometimes the captains and crews abandon the ships, leaving passengers to fend for themselves. Last week: 978 migrants rescued in one day in Mediterranean Sea .

The new findings come from experts who conducted one of the world's largest studies into the effects of HRT - used to ease the effects of menopause. The Women's Health Initiative in the US and the Million Women Study in the UK have both revealed strong evidence that HRT increases a woman's risk of breast, womb and ovarian cancers. The Million Women Study, a collaboration between Cancer Research UK and the NHS, results suggested that women who are using combined HRT have double the risk of breast cancer compared to non-users. And researchers found if women use HRT for more than 10 years, their risks are even higher. Now scientists involved in the Women's Health Initiative study have warned, after further follow-ups, that women who take the combined oestrogen and progesterone HRT therapy continue to have a high risk of breast cancer, up to eight years after they stop treatment. After going through the menopause a woman's ovaries stop producing the hormone oestrogen. It triggers menopausal symptoms including hot flashes and mood swings. HRT treats the body by introducing female sex hormones. There are three types, oestrogen-only HRT, cyclical HRT - where oestrogen is taken continuously but progesterone is given either monthly or every three months - and continuous combined HRT, where both female sex hormones are taken at the same time. In the early 1990s, some smaller studies suggested the therapy would reduce a woman's risk of coronary heart disease and osteoporosis. To examine whether that was the case, the Women's Health Initiative in the US was tasked with investigating. They enrolled more than 26,000 women aged 50 to 79 in the study. Meanwhile, in the UK \u00a0another key study, the Million Women Study, explored the effects of HRT on women aged 50 or over. Both concluded that women prescribed HRT were at a higher risk of breast cancer, than those not receiving the treatment.

I knew what I had done. The whole night is my fault. None of this would have happened if I didn\u2019t drink.' Richards - who has been to rehab three times - was charged with with public intoxication, trespassing, resisting arrest and battery on a police officer and arrested at the Beverly Hills Hotel last week. Sat with Dr. Phil: Kim Richards is speaking out for the first time since her shocking arrest last week following a drunken altercation at The Beverly Hills Hotel . Contradicting reports: Some sources involved in production of Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills say that Kim Richard's protestations that she was sober last season were laughable - while others say she was doing better than ever . Currently, Kim is scheduled to appear at the Los Angeles Superior Court on May 10 following her April 16 incident at the Polo Lounge where she 'caused a disturbance at the hotel restaurant and was taken into custody at the Beverly Hills Police Department.' According to the Richards family friend, Kim's drunk actions were brought on after watching the three-part reunion for the seventh season, which left her 'distraught' and 'very embarrassed.' But that wasn't the only cause. Kim's ex-husband Monty Brinson - who is battling Stage IV cancer - continues to lean on her for support, which fans were able to watch on the recent RHOBH season. 'A big part of all of this is that she is just stressed out,' the pal explained. 'She is under a lot of pressure, especially because of Monty. While Kim Richards staunchly defended herself during the last season of Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills - maintaining that she no longer", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [17.476269960403442], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1736406935.401213}

A pioneering facial surgeon \u2018repeatedly\u2019 punched a patient in the head in an \u2018extraordinary\u2019 attempt to correct a fracture caused by an industrial accident, a medical tribunal has heard. Professor Ninian Peckitt, 63, claimed he had simply \u2018digitally manipulated\u2019 the patient\u2019s face as part of hospital treatment, but witnesses said that in reality he had actually been hitting him, the tribunal was told. The world-renowned surgeon, who has lectured on the use of titanium implants to treat disfigured patients and has been published in academic texts, faces being struck off the medical register after being accused of failing three of his patients. A Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service hearing in Manchester was told a man referred to as Patient A had suffered \u2018extensive injuries\u2019 to the right side of his face in an industrial accident. He was admitted to Ipswich Hospital in February 2012 where Professor Peckitt was working as an honorary locum consultant in oral and maxillo-facial surgery since the previous month. Christopher Hamlet, representing the General Medical Council, told the hearing: \u2018The case is not centred around the outcome, but the method of the surgery by way of the extraordinary allegation that he repeatedly punched the patient in the face.\u2019 He added that Patient A had fallen out of bed which had further displaced his facial fractures. The hearing was told Professor Peckitt embarked on a \u2018closed reduction\u2019 procedure, in which a patient is given anaesthetic before the fractured bone is manually put back together without surgery, and a cast or splint applied. Mr Peckitt was working as an honorary locum at Ipswich Hospital in Suffolk at the time of the alleged incident in February 2012. A medical tribunal will decide whether he should be struck off the register . Professor Peckitt, formerly of Doncaster, later described the procedure as one in which the patient\u2019s face had been \u2018digitally manipulated as best they could be achieved\u2019, the hearing heard. It was also alleged he treated Patient A without seeking advice from colleagues.

The ex-wife of a professional gambler and racehorse trainer has launched a bid for a bigger slice of his legacy, claiming he avoided a huge tax bill by dying. Albert Davison made a fortune by landing a series of six-figure bets on his own horses. When he died, aged 73, he owned a seven-bedroom country estate in Surrey which had been valued at \u00a34.25million. But before he died, in 2011, he and his second wife Penny Ann Davison, 59, fought a bitter battle through the divorce courts for four years over his fortune, before she was awarded just \u00a3750,000. A judge found that Mr Davison had squandered millions of his winnings through 'wasteful expenditure' and 'bad decision making.' But now his beautician ex-wife has now appeared back in court, seeking to boost her slice to more than \u00a31million by claiming his death has freed up more of his cash by allowing him to avoid a huge tax bill. Lord Justice Patten, Lord Justice Briggs and Lady Justice King, sitting at London's Appeal Court, heard that the couple met in 1989 and enjoyed a relationship for five years before marrying in 1994. They had two children before separating in 1999. Divorce proceedings were started by Mrs Davison in 2005 and the battle over the division of the matrimonial assets dragged on for four years. Mr Davison had put the family racing stables, and seven-bedroom detached former matrimonial home at Tillingdown Farm, near Woldingham, into a complex structure of offshore companies and trusts and denied that he had any stake in the property. His lawyers argued that the farm into which he had sunk his gambling fortune was all held in trust for Zoe Davison, his daughter from his first marriage, and his two children from his marriage to Mrs Davison. However, divorce judge, Mrs Justice Baron, ordered the trust controlling the farm to pay out a \u00a3756,", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [17.967264890670776], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1736406970.0474346}

BBC political editor Nick Robinson made a brief return to TV screens last night (pictured), although his voice sounded weak and strained following his cancer surgery . Mr Robinson's voice sounded weak and strained after his treatment for a bronchial carcinoid tumour which involved surgery to stop cancer spreading to other parts of the body. Afterwards he tweeted: 'Good to be back on air. Don't worry about the voice. It doesn't hurt and I'm not risking my recovery.' He said he was listening to his doctors and speech therapist. His return comes at a vital stage of the campaign, when the parties lay out their programmes for government to voters. The Tories' manifesto is unveiled today and the Liberal Democrats' is on Wednesday. Mr Robinson, 51, who is married with three children, has been sent an outpouring of good wishes, led by Prime Minister David Cameron. In a message recorded for the BBC website earlier yesterday, Mr Robinson said his return was a 'small step' and he did not expect to return to the campaign trail full-time at this stage.

But it's not that hard for us to make well people feel worse.\nArticle: (CNN) -- The freedom to test is a good thing. But it's not that hard for us to make well people feel worse.  The disturbing truth is that it is hard for us to make well people feel better.  But it's not that hard for us to make them feel worse. Decades of research have shown that there are real side-effects to testing the well: more anxiety (that can't be good for your health), more procedures (which often involve needles, pain and can even lead to complications like collapsed lungs) and more treatment for \"disease\" not destined to cause problems (as in over a million additional American men treated for prostate cancer, ditto women for breast cancer).  To see how far wrong testing can go, check out South Korea: where ultrasound screening has increased the amount of thyroid cancer -- and thyroid cancer surgery -- by 15-fold. I can tell you one thing for sure, the freedom to test won't save money.  Sure, a competitive market will drive down prices for individual tests.   But advertising will drive up the volume of testing.  And then there are all the office visits and subsequent testing for the abnormal results.  This will cost people real money -- either in terms of higher insurance premiums or higher out-of-pocket costs. Maybe this kind of freedom of information isn't such a good thing. Of course, there have been genuine advances in diagnostic testing.  Diagnostic tests can be extremely useful in sorting out acute medical problems.  But if you feel well, don't think that testing will make you feel better. The biotech sector is excited about testing well people -- it's a huge market -- and is developing lots of new product.

Now you can monitor your vital signs on your smartwatch, soon you will be able to test your breath for lung cancer on a phone app.  They are even impl", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [17.457590341567993], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1736407153.8181255}

The 16-stone British Gas engineer, who was travelling alone, confronted Mr Phillips and his wife June, 69, about their rudeness in ignoring him when he joined their table for dinner, a court heard. The couple were knocked unconscious after he allegedly assaulted them outside their cabin. But yesterday Finlay said he only swung his arms to defend himself when Mr Phillips went for him with his crutch. He denied attacking Mrs Phillips. He claimed Mr Phillips threw a cup of cocoa in his face and hit him with the crutch when he demanded an apology. He told the court: \u2018I felt myself being struck by something sharp and I put my arms over my face to defend myself \u2013 I covered my face with my arms, I didn\u2019t want my eye poked out.\u2019 He said he swung his arms outwards and felt them connect with retired engineer Mr Phillips, from Middlesbrough. They were on board the Thomson Celebration liner off Lanzarote when the incident happened in January last year. Finlay, a Glaswegian, gave jurors at Teesside Crown Court a picture of the social pitfalls of the lone traveller when he described being snubbed in the restaurant. He said he enjoyed going to musical shows and filled his time with excursions, but dinner could be a \u2018bit awkward\u2019. He recalled joining two couples and said \u2018good evening\u2019 as he sat down. \u2018I am actually quite a shy person \u2013 it is not particularly easy for me when I meet strangers,\u2019 he added. \u2018One of the ladies opposite me said \u201cgood evening\u201d back, but the other three didn\u2019t say anything to me, which I thought was a bit awkward. I was handed a menu and realised I was going to be in the situation for the next hour or so. \u2018I then spotted", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [17.24323868751526], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1736407171.0879002}

Wang Fang, the mother of his son, added: 'What can I do now? I don't love him any more, but I do love my son.' The women have now set up an online Facebook group so they can all chat and are quickly discovering just how much he hid from them, South China Morning Post reported. The story has attracted a lot of attention on social media, with some condemning Mr Yuan's actions and others expressing admiration.

A Connecticut juvenile court judge issued a written decision Wednesday denying a motion to let the teen, identified in court documents as \"Cassandra C.,\" go home. The judge also denied a motion for visitation. The 17-year-old is in remission after nearly six months of forced chemo treatments. On March 16, Michtom tried to convince the court that she should be able to return to her mother's home because she was no longer at imminent risk of harm from her illness. Michtom and attorney Michael Taylor, who represents Cassandra's mother, Jackie Fortin, released a written statement after receiving the judge's decision Wednesday: \"We are disappointed in this ruling, not least of all because it draws a factual conclusion that is directly contradicted by the weight of the evidence. We're conferring with our clients now about next steps, including whether to take another appeal.\" Cassandra was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma in September and medical experts gave her an 85% chance of survival if treated with chemotherapy. Without it, doctors said at the time, she was likely to die within two years. She started chemotherapy in November but ran away after two days, according to court documents, when she decided she did not want to put the poison of the treatment into her body. In December, a judge ordered the young woman to be under the custody of the Connecticut Department of Children and Families. At that time, she was admitted to Connecticut Children's Medical Center in Hartford and has remained there since then. Doctors surgically implanted a port in Cassandra's chest to administer chemotherapy medications, which began in spite of legal maneuvers to halt them.

Internet companies iiNet Limited, Internode, Amnet Broadband, Dodo Services, Adam Internet and Wideband Networks were all affected by the ruling . But legals experts say even if you are hit with a legal threat there are several ways to defend the accusations, Fairfax Media reports. iiNet's former chief regulatory officer, Steve Dalby, said the letter was not proof and it would be difficult for the film's studio to prove someone downloaded it. He said those hit with legal letters should also consider whether anyone else may have had access to their network. 'They can't detect downloaders so if I downloaded it but never shared it I wouldn't be concerned about it,' Mr Dalby said. 'If they're not guilty and had an open access point that was unsecured or were very free to giving their password out to people then maybe they do have the defence that it wasn't them. 'Most of the agreements state the account holder is responsible for the use of the account but there's no formal, legal obligation for customers to secure their WiFi.' He said if a letter did show up, it was important to seek legal advice. Slaters Intellectual Property Lawyers' Anny Slater told Fairfax Media there were many avenues for people to get advice. 'As to people getting access to justice and support, this case has brought to light the situation so there are many avenues for people to get advice on a cost effective basis,' she said. 'Some might argue innocence, some might argue that they didn't understand the repercussions, some might argue that the only access to the material was this way because prices were so high.' iiNet has warned its customers to expect speculative invoicing - an 'intimidating' letter demanding significant sums of up to US$7000 for an alleged infringement, or threatening court action .

The order, issued in April by the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, requires Verizon on an \"ongoing, daily basis\" to give the National Security Agency information on all telephone calls in its systems, both within the U.S. and between the U.S. and other countries. The court order, which was granted in April and is good until July 19, requires Verizon to produce \"on an ongoing daily basis\" and in \"real time\" information such as a telephone number or the length of a call, the Guardian reported. The order does not require Verizon to provide the NSA with the content of the calls, the newspaper said. The Guardian said the order was granted under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows the government to obtain warrants to monitor the activities of foreign agents in the United States. The newspaper said it had obtained a copy of the order from documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. The Guardian said the order \"requires no individualized suspicion of wrongdoing\" by the person whose records are being examined.

The defense asserts that the Boston Marathon bombings never would have happened if it weren't for Tamerlan. They have portrayed him as obsessed with jihad, spending hours in his computer trolling al Qaeda-style websites. An uncle in Russia told the FBI that Tamerlan came there in 2012, expecting to find \"jihad in the streets.\" Magomed Kartashov was questioned by the FBI after 40 days in a Russian jail. The FBI summary report of the interview was read in court. Kartashov said his nephew asked him if he had contacts with people \"in the forest,\" as locals referred to the jihadists. Tamerlan's information came from the Internet, but he had surprisingly little knowledge of Islam, the uncle told the FBI. When he asked his nephew why he wanted to go to the forest, he responded that \"jihad was necessary today,\" Kartashov told the FBI. \"I told him to stop or he wouldn't make it to the next tree.\" Jahar, on the other hand, was portrayed in the testimony of five of his former teachers as a smart, sweet kid who worked hard and earned good grades.

Michelle Newman said all she heard was a 'pop' and looked up to see her son James' heels as he fell from the second floor of their condo in Las Vegas. The child had fallen out of the window, which had been propped open to let in the breeze, and died from his injuries. James Krainch was almost two-years-old when he toppled out of a second floor condo window and died . Michelle Newman visits James' grave with her other children Kierah (centre) and Spencer (right) and said they play games at his grave, flying kites and laughing, so they can remember their brother in a positive way . 'When I got to his side, he gave me one last smile and then went unconscious,' Mrs Newman told the Deseret News. On the ninth anniversary of his death Ms Newman visited her son's grave with her two other children Spencer and Kierah Krainich to celebrate the life of their brother. 'A lot of times we'll fly kites and we'll play games,' she said. 'We'll do things I think James would have liked doing with us.' James was 22 months and tumbled from the window because a screen was not strong enough to hold him . Ms Newman said James, who was 22 months old when he died, had fallen from the window as he was sat on the sofa, while she fed his younger brother who was then around six months old. The screen was not strong enough to prevent him from tumbling to the ground. Michelle Newman said she hopes by sharing her story other parents will safety proof their homes . She added: 'I just heard a pop and I looked over my shoulder and I just saw his heels as he toppled out the window,' After he hit the ground James lost consciousness and was rushed to hospital. Doctors worked for hours to save his life, but he died on April 20. The family eventually moved to Utah and Ms Newman split up with her husband and father to her children, Joe Krainch.

Paris Saint-Germain striker Ibrahimovic will now miss three games and Marseille playmaker Payet just one after both clubs succeeded with appeals to the French Olympic Committee (CNOSF). Ibrahimovic was initially banned for four games by the French Football League (LFP) when he was caught on camera after last month's 3-2 defeat to Bordeaux launching into a tirade against official Lionel Jaffredo while walking back to the dressing room. Zlatan Ibrahimovic has had his four-game ban reduced by one match after successfully appealing . Ibrahimovic was heard swearing as he walked towards the changing room after PSG's loss against Bordeaux . The Swede reacted angrily to the defeat and said it was the worst refereeing display he'd ever seen . He was angered by suggestions his remarks were also derogatory to France as a whole and claimed his words had been 'twisted'. Speaking in the video in English but in partial sentences, the Sweden international could be heard saying: 'He's an a******. Play 15 years, never seen referee this s*** country. Don't even deserve PSG should be in this country. F****** too good for all of you. Should be happy they exist.' Marseille playmaker Payet then received a two-game sanction after aiming expletives at the closed door of the match officials' dressing room following the goalless draw with Lyon, in which Lucas Ocampos' late strike was deemed not to have crossed the goal-line. A statement from OM read: 'Olympique de Marseille received on Friday an official notification that the (LFP) has accepted the proposal of the CNOSF concerning the suspension of Dimitri Payet.

In a statement, the group said the bomber was named Abu Mohammad and he belonged to their ranks. He was targeting government workers collecting their pay at the bank, the terrorists said. He detonated his charge at the peak of rush hour on the first day of the week, when the bank would be expected to be crowded. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid, in a text message to journalists, distanced his group from the attack. \"The explosion in Jalalabad doesn't have anything to do with us and we condemn it,\" he said. ISIS refers to Afghanistan and Pakistan as the province of \"Khorasan.\" In March, CNN reported on ISIS recruiting in Afghanistan. The United Nations condemned the violence. \"The continuing use of suicide attacks in densely populated areas, that are certain to kill and maim large numbers of Afghan civilians, may amount to a war crime,\" said Nicholas Haysom, head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. The United Nations said that in the first three months of the year 655 people were killed and 1,155 were wounded in suicide attacks throughout the country. Fears about ISIS involvement in the region have been growing this year. In February, Mullah Abdul Rauf, a former Taliban commander who had become a recruiter for ISIS in Afghanistan, was killed in a drone strike, according to officials who spoke to CNN. And later that same week, Gen. John Campbell, the top U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that he was concerned about the growth of ISIS in the area. \"You do have some of the Taliban breaking", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [16.3057701587677], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1736407559.051096}

Brelo is the lone officer among the 13 who fired their weapons that night who is charged criminally because prosecutors say he stood on the hood and opened fire four seconds after the other officers had stopped shooting . Brelo's attorney Patrick D'Angelo conceded that his tactics could be called into question given that Brelo exposed himself to danger when he stepped onto the hood of a beat-up Chevy Malibu to fire 15 rounds into the windshield of the suspects' vehicle . But Brelo and 12 officers who shot a total of 137 rounds into the car in November 2012 had ample reason to believe that Russell and Williams were shooting at them, he said . Brelo's defense team has argued that all 49 rounds Brelo fired that night, including the last 15, were lawful . The threat from the pair didn't end until Brelo reached into the Malibu and removed the keys to prevent the suspects from using the car as a weapon, according to his defense . Russell and Williams were each shot more than 20 times . The chase started with a failed traffic stop on the edge of downtown by a plainclothes detective who never reported to dispatchers that he'd lost sight of the vehicle . Russell then sped past Cleveland police headquarters, where his car backfired . Officers and witnesses standing outside were certain they'd heard gunshots and a police radio call for shots fired triggered an adrenaline-fueled rush by officers to join the chase . Brelo and his partner were two of the first officers to join the pursuit that ultimately included more than 60 police cars, 104 officers and reached at least 100mph . After driving into a school parking lot more than 20 minutes after the chase began, Russell turned the car around and tried to flee again - sideswiping a cruiser before coming to a stop .

If that falls flat, Glory will go through the FFA's appeals process in a bid to either overturn the decision, or reduce the penalty. 'This season, our player payments, paid under the salary cap, are forecast to be below that salary cap threshold of $2.55 million,' Glory chief executive Jason Brewer said.

FFA chief executive David Gallop said he expects Perth's management to be removed in the wake of the mess . December 17: Fairfax publishes a report claiming it has seen documents showing Perth Glory may have exceeded the salary cap for up to three seasons. It claims Glory failed to disclose numerous benefits it paid to players and their agents. February 12: FFA issues Glory with show-cause notice alleging the club failed to disclose numerous benefits to players over a three-year period. Perth Glory chief executive Jason Brewer claims the club will still be well under the salary cap even if these other costs are included. February 16: FFA staff head to Perth's offices to conduct a salary cap audit. April 1: FFA issues Glory with second show-cause notice relating to alleged serious breaches.

China's pollution hit cities are now having to cope with a fresh nuisance after the fourth massive sandstorm struck the north-west of the country this year alone. The images show the city of Golmud, in the country's north west Qinghai Province, as it succumbs to a sweeping half-hour sandstorm which reduced the visibility to as little as 30 metres, according to\u00a0The People's Daily Online. The raging sand storm sweeps in on the city of Golmud in north west China, where 200,000 people live . The sandstorm was the fourth to hit the area this year as authorities struggle to deal with the natural hazards . China's Meteorlogical Centre issued a blue alert as the sandstorms swept across the north of the country . China's National Meteorological Centre (NMC) has now issued a blue alert for the latest sandstorms to hit the northern regions. The red sand swept across the northern part of the country bringing strong winds and floating sand to the regions of Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Ningxia and Shaanxi, in what was the fourth sandstorm to hit the area this year. The organisation advised residents to stay indoors and local authorities to brace for the clean-up operation after the sandstorms. China's four-tier colour-coded weather warning system signifies red as the most severe followed by orange, yellow and blue. Photos of the city of Dunhuang in the north-western province of Gansu show the thick orange haze coating the city's atmosphere and the lack of people on the streets gave the area an almost alien planet appearance. A local meteorologist said visibility was reduced to less than 50metres in downtown areas. Police spokesman Hui Chuang said: 'The storm forced most people to stay indoors because it was difficult to drive anyway given the low visibility and also hard to breathe without inhaling sand. 'It also forced the closure of the nearby Mogao Grottoes.' The site is a UNESCO world heritage tourist site renowned", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [16.44486665725708], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1736407644.0027072}

Scroll down for video Yoga for men: From downward dog to warrior pose, Broga is becoming increasingly popular thanks to its 'rugged' approach to traditional yoga workouts Making a point: Traditionally seen as an exercise regime for women, yoga is changing and now has a more universal appeal 'I consider myself an athletic guy, but have never been flexible and didn't like the thought of embarrassing myself in front of a group of women,' said financial analyst and Broga enthusiast Eric Wright, 22, from San Jose, California. Founder: Robert Sidoti (pictured) is the creator and co-Founder of Broga Eric and his male colleagues use the video streaming service Grokker, which is aimed at broadcasting fitness, food and yoga classes directly to your home or office, to partake in their weekly yoga sessions. 'On Wednesdays we have a standing Broga appointment and anywhere from five to eight others will join me,' he said. Grokker founder and CEO Lorna Borenstein said more men are adding yoga to their exercise routines as a cross-training tool for flexibility and improving recovery time. Even if they spend most of their time focusing on more high intensity gym training, men are now using yoga as a useful warm-up method. 'Men are a little late to the party,' she said. 'But we're seeing more men in the workplace who find time to do yoga together a few times a week.'

No serious injuries were reported in the crashes on U.S. Highway 36 between Boulder and Denver, but tow-truck drivers were kept busy hauling away damaged cars.

A car is stuck under a semi tractor trailer at the scene of a multi-vehicle pileup on U.S. Highway 36 . Numerous crashes and spin outs on icy and snowy highways have closed portions of several interstates and highways in the Denver and Colorado Springs area as well as the mountains . 'My car was just sitting there on this little island on its own,' she said. 'It was pretty surreal. I feel pretty lucky today.' In Aurora, near Denver, one person died after being thrown from an Oldsmobile Bravada that lost control and rolled on an icy stretch of Interstate 225, striking a passing public bus. The only person on the bus was its driver, who wasn't hurt. Another person in the Oldsmobile was taken to a hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening, police said. Near Fort Carson, the Colorado State Patrol responded to a series of rush-hour crashes involving a total of nearly 20 cars. In the mountains, Interstate 70 was temporarily closed after several trucks spun out on snowy Vail Pass. At lower elevations, the storm left only light snow on grass, and roads were largely clear because of recent warm weather. However, motorists driving at normal speeds were surprised by icy patches, especially on bridges, said Trooper James Schmidt of the Colorado State Patrol. 'We're in Colorado.

The 22-year-old winger was signed by then Old Trafford boss Sir Alex Ferguson in January 2013 from Crystal Palace for \u00a310million. But the terms of the transfer saw him loaned straight back to the Eagles for the remainder of the season and he did not arrive at Old Trafford until the summer, by which time Ferguson had retired and been replaced by David Moyes. During a disastrous campaign for the club under Moyes, Zaha made just four United appearances before playing out the second half of last season at Cardiff. 'There is nothing worse than not being involved,' he told the Daily Telegraph. 'You are sitting there thinking 'what exactly am I? A footballer who is not playing football?' You feel a bit worthless sitting in the stands, watching all the time. You have nothing to speak about with the players. Zaha made just four appearances for Manchester United in two years with the club . 'If you have played the game then it's \"well done\" or \"you should have passed here or there\". But when you haven't played... I think people lose a bit of respect for you. I think they are thinking 'well, he's not played'. They don't have anything to speak to you about. It's a big thing.' 'There were so many rumours about me that were not true. And they hurt me because all I was doing was keeping my head down to do my best every time and then after training I'd go home and there would be something in the paper or wherever about me not having a good attitude and that's why I wasn't playing, rumours about my private life and that's why I wasn't playing, me turning up late for this, turning up late for that.' Zaha revealed the last straw came when he was left on the bench against League One outfit MK Dons as United crashed out of the Capital One Cup 4-0 last August. Eventually he spoke to new United boss Louis Van Gaal, who confirmed that he wasn't part of his first-team plans and so he headed back on a season-long loan deal to Palace, where he", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [16.28755831718445], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1736407761.6775126}

Andrew Caldwell, 21, was covered in the dessert after he was recognized by a cashier at a St. Louis FroYo store. He said the woman called him a gay slur, said that it was impossible for God to 'turn' gay people straight, and then picked up the extra large bowl from the scale at the counter and aggressively threw it in Caldwell's face. However the employee, Stephanie Diaz, says Caldwell is a liar. In an interview with the same TV station, Diaz said Caldwell demanded a discount for his yogurt. When she didn't relent, he called her a 'dog' and a 'b----', Diaz said. Diaz, who is openly gay, said it had nothing to do with the viral video. 'I threw the ice cream at him,' she said outside of the store Thursday. 'He called me a dog. \u2026 I lost it.' 'I lost it': Stephanie Diaz, who is openly gay, admits to throwing the yogurt at Caldwell, but said he is lying about his story .

She has been charged with third-degree assault. However Diaz has not been fired. FroYo have said any punishment that should occur from the incident will be handled internally.

Mrs Culley\u00a0said: 'My waters had broken and my husband was on the phone to get his mum to take us to hospital. 'But by the time she got here, the baby had already been born.

Since then, however, Adebayor's goal return has become significantly more modest and he has not scored in the league for Spurs since the 2-1 defeat to Newcastle back in October.

The story was shared 30,000 times in six hours and the ban was lifted after complaints, WKRG reported. Brandi said: 'I posted the status with a link about it saying no one's going to keep me from posting photos of my child. 'If I can see completely distasteful things on Facebook all day long, then I can post a picture of my son. 'He was everywhere and he broke the internet!' Eli's parents, Brandi McGlathery (left) and Troy Thompson (right) are raising money for him on GoFundMe . Eli had to undergo a tracheotomy at only five days old. Doctors hope to be able to drill nasal passages in Eli's skull which will allow him to breathe when he is older. A family friend set up a GoFundMe page to help Eli's parents pay for his care. Brandi wrote: 'He will have to have a tracheoomy & a feeding bag inserted into his stomach, which is also not what I expected. 'I would be so grateful for anything anyone could spare, but if you cannot afford to help with money I will be just as appreciative for prayers for my sweet Eli. 'He has a long road a head of him & we need all the support we can get.' Doctors hope to be able to drill nasal passages in Eli's skull when he's older which will allow him to breathe . After he was born, Eli was treated at the USA Children's and Women's Hospital in Mobile for three weeks. McGlathery, 23, is diligently tracking the ups and down", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [16.53247570991516], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1736407946.0512867}

{"model_id": "llama-2-13b", "choices": [{"turns": "An explorer who plans to spend a year living inside a ball-shaped capsule on top of an iceberg is seeking funding for his daring project. Italian Alex Bellini is to be subjected to the full force of the iceberg as it melts, cracks and even flips - while hopefully staying safe inside his small spherical cabin. The aim of the cabin fever-inducing stunt is to highlight how global warming will melt icebergs around the world and cause sea levels to rise. Scroll down for video . Italian Alex Bellini will live atop an iceberg in Greenland starting next year. He will live inside a contained ball (artist's illustration shown), with no means to escape for 12 months. The capsule will be 10ft (three metres) wide and could fit 10 people - but Mr Bellini will remove all of the seats apart from one, for himself . Mr Bellini, 36, is seeking funding for his project, called Adrift, which he hopes to begin in November 2016. Previous feats by the explorer include running more than 14,000 miles (22,500km), rowing more than 21,000 miles (34,000km) and spending 560 days in isolation. He has rowed both the Atlantic and Pacific and insists he favours challenges where there is a perceived lack of control. The capsules, initially designed essentially as escape pods for areas at risk of tsunami, can hold from two to ten people and range in price from \u00a38,000 to \u00a313,500 ($12,000 to $20,000). Four are currently in use in Japan, while two are in the US. Mr Bellini will use one at the upper scale, 10ft (three metres) wide - although he\u2019ll remove all the seats except one for himself.

The splatters of blood on the checklist for the very first US spacewalk were from an astronaut as he frantically battled to close the hatch door of the spacecraft after a historic venture. But the Gemini 4 mission of June 1965 ultimately proved successfully, and paved the way to astronauts walking on the moon for the first time four years later. A complete 13-page checklist, including a bloodstained document seen at the front), from the Gemini 4 mission in June 1965 is tipped to sell for a huge \u00a380,000 ($120,000). The list shows the various steps the astronauts had to go through when opening and closing the hatch to space . Gemini 4 launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on 3 June 1965 with two astronauts on board. One, Ed White, was tasked with performing the first US spacewalk, less than three months after Soviet Alexey Leonov had completed the first spacewalk in history. The two astronauts on the Gemini 4 mission were Jim McDivitt and Ed White. The Gemini programme of the 1960s was designed to develop and test capabilities that would ultimately land humans on the moon in the Apollo missions. The first crewed Gemini flight, Gemini 3, lifted off Launch Pad 19 at Cape Canaveral in Florida on March 23, 1965. Nasa's two-man Gemini spaceflights demonstrated that astronauts could change their capsule's orbit, remain in space for at least two weeks and work outside their spacecraft. They also pioneered rendezvous and docking with other spacecraft. All were essential skills to land on the moon and return safely to Earth. They orbited Earth 66 times over four days and, on the first day, Ed White donned a spacesuit and drifted out of the cramped capsule. He spent 20 minutes in space on the spacewalk, or extravehicular activity", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [17.80923581123352], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1736408031.7622974}

The damage was just part of the destruction caused by cowboy builders who had been called in to fix a leak in the Beckle-Raymond's three bedroom property in North London. Instead, they left Phillip, his wife Gaby and their two young children, Orion and Aurielle, in an unsafe building with no roof while they ran off with \u00a317,000 of their money. Scroll down for video . Phillip and Gaby outside their London home which was left a wreck thanks to cowboy builders . 'When the builders walked out, we only had tarpaulin protecting the house throughout winter,' Gaby explains on Channel 5 show Britain's Horror Homes. 'When it rained, water started coming in, it was raining inside our house. The box room caved in, the bathroom became bowed, the ceiling will fall in the children's room. 'The most terrifying experience was the ceiling falling in the bedroom where we used to sleep. It collapsed where our bed used to be. We weren't in room at time thankfully.' For six months, the family were forced to live in one room of the house as they couldn't afford to get the problems fixed straight away, having already shelled out to the cowboy builders who left them in the lurch. Phillip, a civil servant, said: 'The house was crumbling around us, we had to turn off the lights as water was getting into electricity, it was that time of year when it was getting dark at 4pm, it was miserable. I hated leaving Gaby and the children like that when I had to go to work.' Phillip and Gaby had used all their savings to buy the property five years before for \u00a3325,000. The builders left the family with no roof and just\u00a0tarpaulin protecting the house from the winter elements. As a result, rain got into the property causing ceilings to collapse . The parents say they are devastated at being 'taken for a ride'. It will cost \u00a335,000 to repair their home . As they started a family, they worked hard to turn the house into a happy and comfortable place to raise their children.

The Guardian said the order requires Verizon to provide the NSA with \"metadata\" -- such as a list of numbers involved in a call -- but not the content of the call. The newspaper said the order does not allow the government to listen in or record calls, but it does allow the agency to discover who is talking to whom. The Guardian said the order does not apply to Verizon's newFiOS service, which it said is not yet available to the majority of the company's customers. The newspaper said the order was granted under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which requires the government to obtain a warrant from the secret court to conduct surveillance. The Guardian said the order was granted on April 25 and is good until July 19.

Jack Rivera, a New York trucker, captured the collision on his dashcam as he drove along the Interstate 35E in Texas last Wednesday. Footage shows the driver of a black SUV, identified as 49-year-old Laura Michelle Mayeaux, coming off at the 397 exit and veering over to the wrong side of the lane. She then steers head-on into a truck which rolls over on its side with debris flying everywhere. As the back end of the 18-wheeler swings out, it pushes a red pickup truck off course. Thick black skid marks can be seen on the tarmac as smoke fills the air. Rivera told\u00a0waxahachietx.com\u00a0that once things came to a standstill he got out of his vehicle to see if he could offer any assistance to the parties involved before authorities arrived. The incident, which occurred just past 6pm, shut the highway for around two hours.

He then used those passwords to log on to their accounts himself. After hacking into the university computer system, Uddin changed the marks that he had been given for previous assessments. On one paper, he upped his mark from 57 per cent, a lower second grade, to 73 per cent, a first. He carried out his plot using keyboard \u2018shadowing\u2019 devices which look like a USB stick and can be bought for as little as \u00a349 on the internet. He plugged these into the back of a number of staff computers at the University of Birmingham where he was studying. The device records everything which is typed into the keyboard and saves the data. Uddin, from Birmingham, was in his final year of a bio-science course. At the time of the hacking he was expected to achieve a 2:2 degree. He was jailed for four months at Birmingham Crown Court on Thursday after admitting six charges which were in breach of the Computer Misuse Act. Sentencing him, Judge James Burbridge said it was unclear why Uddin had tried to change his grades. Judge Burbridge said: \u2018For reasons not entirely clear to me, whether it was monetary, or pride, or a desire to outperform others, you decided to cheat and you formed a settled intention to do that. I consider your actions were planned and persistent.\u2019 He warned that Uddin\u2019s behaviour could have undermined public confidence in the degree system. The judge added that he felt compelled to put Uddin behind bars as a \u2018deterrence\u2019 to others. Judge Burbridge said: \u2018This kind of conduct undermines, or has the potential to undermine, public confidence in the degree system, set up by this university. I have decided I cannot pass a suspended sentence because there needs to be an element of deter", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [16.844268083572388], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1736408239.238289}

Males and females typically find a spot to mate in about five minutes. And the male will cover up the eggs to protect them from predators. Shown is another torrent frog, the Waterfall frog . The new species of torrent frog, reported by New Scientist, is called Hylodes japi. The amphibian, part of the Hylodes lateristrigatus group, is characterised by light stripes on its size, while it is also relatively small, according to the researchers. And when it comes to mating, this family of frogs has a unique trait not seen in other frogs. They typically like to live near fast streams and, if a pair decides to mate, they will spend five minutes searching for a private spot. \u2018The male quickly carves out a chamber by excavating the sand around small rocks at the bottom of the stream,\u2019 said Agata Blaszczak-Boxe from New Scientist. \u2018Then, like Christian Grey from Fifty Shades he invites his mate into his sex dungeon, which is only just big enough to fit the two amorous amphibians.\u2019 The amphibian, part of the Hylodes lateristrigatus group, is characterised by light stripes on its size, while it is also relatively small, according to the researchers. It was found in the Atlantic forest of Serra do Japi in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil . Once the female has laid her eggs, the male then covers up the entrance with sand from the stream. The reason for this is not only to protect the eggs from predators, but also from tadpoles of the species - as they are known to be cannibalistic. Finding the frogs wasn\u2019t easy, either - they are so secretive that the researchers had to don camouflage gear in order to observe them. A new species of glass frog (shown right) has been discovered with translucent skin so you can see its insides. The creature, named Hyalinobatrachium dianae, was found in the mountains of eastern Costa Rica and has a distinctive call.

That treble was Ronaldo's 31st career hat-trick and his 24th in La Liga, equalling Lionel Messi's record in the competition. It also took his formidable goal tally for the Bernabeu club to 299 in 287 matches. Against Granada, Ronaldo has now scored 11 times in just eight matches. But, compared with some, they have got off quite lightly. We take a look at the clubs who have suffered the most at the hands of the Portuguese wonder. Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals as Real Madrid thrashed Granada 9-1 on Sunday afternoon . The Portuguese superstar was simply irresistible as Real ran riot at the Bernabeu . SEVILLA - 18 Goals in 12 matches . There's no denying it - Ronaldo just loves playing against Sevilla, whose defence must be terrified every time they see him. Three of those La Liga hat-tricks have come against the team from Andalusia - he scored triples in a 6-2 win at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan in May 2011, a 4-1 success at the Bernabeu in February 2013 and a 7-3 thrashing in October of the same year. But they aren't even Ronaldo's best return. He scored four goals, including a 12-minute hat-trick, in another 6-2 win in Seville back in May 2011. Most recently, Ronaldo scored twice in Real's 2-0 UEFA Super Cup win over Sevilla in August.

The young midfielder was clearly in awe of the former World Cup winning striker and simply wrote 'legend' alongside the picture on Instagram. Ronaldo, who scored more than 100 goals for Real and netted an impressive 62 international goals, was visiting his old club ahead of their Champions League quarter-final second-leg clash against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday. Odegaard opted to join Real Madrid after courting interest from a host of top clubs in Europe, including Manchester United and Liverpool, and signed a long-term \u00a340,000 a week contract with the Champions League winners in January. The former Stromgodset playmaker has trained with Carlo Ancelotti's first team regularly since his arrival, rubbing shoulder's with the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale. Odegaard is said to be on a different wave length to his Castilla team-mates because he rarely trains with them . The 16-year-old joined Real Madrid for \u00a32.3million in January signing a long-term \u00a340,000 a week contract . But the Norwegian wonderkid has found life tough at the Spanish giants in recent weeks. First team coach in waiting Zinedine Zidane dropped Odegaard from his Castilla side earlier this month after a dramatic downturn in results since his arrival. There have been suggestions that his presence in the side has riled team-mates that feel Odegaard training with the first team three times a week means he lacks cohesion in the B team. Real Madrid are desperate for the Castilla side to win promotion to the second tier of Spanish football and Zidane has to decide whether that goal is more attainable without the young talent.\nArticle: (CNN) -- A 16-year-old boy has been arrested in connection with the murder of a 17-year-old girl in the English city of Leicester, police said", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [16.293749809265137], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1736408344.6933954}

Such was the severity of her eating disorder, that the 15-year-old was admitted to hospital twice and faced rigorous counselling sessions. Today, Emma, whose decision to release the photos is supported by her mother Kim Waddington, said she wants to help other anorexia sufferers. By combating the compulsion to be skinny - and instead focusing on getting fit and building her muscle definition - she is now a healthier eight stone. Emma's mother Kim, left, said it was devastating watching her daughter face her 'horrific' ordeal . 'I wouldn't want anyone to go through what I went through,' Emma said. 'I went through hell. 'I've realised I was miserable when I'd lost weight. 'But I've learned so much from what I've been through and if my story can even help one person beat anorexia, I would be so happy. 'I'm 10 times stronger than I've ever been before.' Ms Waddington described watching her daughter battle the eating disorder as a 'horrific' ordeal. 'I felt so out of control and every day is a battle. I woke up thinking about it and would go to bed thinking about it,' she said. 'It's a monster that had taken over my daughter and we were fighting that monster every day. It was horrific watching my daughter go through it all.'

Within weeks her weight had plummeted to eight stone, but she was compelled to shed more. 'I would go online about 100 times a day, obsessively trying to find new ways of losing weight,' she said.

Caught on camera: Police in Maryland are hunting for a 'heartless' thief (seen above on CCTV footage) who stole a four-year-old boy's wheelchair in the middle of the night. Distraught: The youngster's mother left the wheelchair in the lobby of their building on Merrimac Drive, Langley Park, as usual on Sunday evening since it's easier to carry her son to their second floor apartment . Prince George's County Police have released a piece of surveillance footage which shows a person pushing the empty chair in a parking lot. They're asking anyone with information about the case to contact investigators. The film appears to show a dark-haired white male dressed in a jacket and pants. A cash reward is being offered. Commenting on the incident, Capt. Ken Humbel said: 'This family already faces challenges and shouldn't be burdened with the emotional and financial stress of the theft of this wheelchair. Flashback: The boy's mother has shared a video of her son using his chair  in a bid to trigger tip offs . 'The suspect we\u2019re looking for has no heart.'

While officers search for the suspect, they're in talks with a foundation that may help find a replacement chair in the meantime.

The cost of paying for rising numbers of deaths as the unprecedented numbers of post-World War Two babies come to the end of their lives may be too much for many families, a report said. It predicted that numbers of deaths in Britain, which have been falling for 40 years, will start to go up and increase by 20 per cent over the next two decades. At the same time the price of a funeral is rising fast, thanks to higher costs for cremation, rising undertakers\u2019 bills as funeral firms are faced with bad debts, and the increasing fees demanded by churches. Deaths in Britain, which have been falling for 40 years, will start to go up and increase by 20 per cent over the next two decades, a report by a think tank has found (file photo) The report, prepared by an old age think tank, the International Longevity Centre-UK, and backed by insurance firm OneFamily, suggests that younger people who already feel financially hard pressed in comparison to their parents will still be under money pressure even after their deaths. Younger people are finding it increasingly difficult to afford homes or to start families, and in the long-term their pensions are much less secure than those of their parents, many of whom enjoyed the generous and fast-disappearing defined benefit pension system. The report from ILC-UK to be published next week said that death rates are set to go up following a long period in which medical advances, better diet, healthier lifestyles and the growing unpopularity of smoking, and the decline of dangerous heavy industrial jobs, have meant fewer people have been dying despite a rising population. \u2018After decades of the number of deaths in the UK falling, 2015 will mark a tipping point where the historic trend starts to reverse,\u2019 it said. \u2018As the oldest of the baby boomer generation move through their later years, deaths are predicted to rise by 20 per cent.\u2019 It added: \u2018This will have significant implications for current forecasts of funeral costs and highlights a growing need for families to broach the delicate subject of end of life expenses.\u2019 A 'simple' funeral", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [16.88867950439453], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1736408429.6073558}

He was wanted by Lincolnshire Police over an alleged domestic violence and assault. After fleeing his home, the 22-year-old goaded officers by sharing photographs online which showed him standing outside the force's headquarters. He was eventually arrested in November in a cafe after posing outside five different police stations over two weeks and was this week jailed for eight months. But after spending less than five months behind bars since his arrest, the 22-year-old has already been released. Last year Bee taunted officers by captioning photographs 'come catch me if you can' and bragging that he was 'always playing hide and seek'. He visited five different police stations without being apprehended and even flashing his genitals outside one. The father of one had been wanted by police for breaking a non-molestation order against his former girlfriend after showing up at her house in the middle of the night. Lincoln Crown Court heard how he had been 'threatening and abusive' towards the woman when he 'kicked her door down' last October.

He was jailed yesterday for eight months but has been released after spending less than five months behind bars since being arrested . When police couldn't find him after the assault they released his mugshot to appeal for his whereabouts. In response, Bee took to Facebook to mock their efforts. Among pictures he shared online was one of a police officer standing in the street which he captioned 'is it me you're looking for'. He also posed outside Lincolnshire Police HQ, looking towards the camera and giving a thumbs up. In other posts he said the justice system 'is really f****d up' and bragged about buying a doughnut in Tesco without being caught. At the time, he said he was taunting police 'because it's funny.' He told reporters: 'It's really funny, I wanted to do it to show how ridiculous this all is and how they obviously aren't that bothered about me", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [16.829128742218018], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1736408446.4630854}

Jeffrey Sterling, 46, was charged with unauthorized disclosure of national defense information, according to a statement from the Justice Department. Sterling was arrested in St. Louis on Thursday and is expected to appear in federal court on Friday. The Justice Department said Sterling, who worked as an intelligence officer at the CIA, provided classified information to a New York Times reporter in 2003. The information was used in a 2006 New York Times article about Operation Merlin, a CIA operation that was designed to disrupt Iran's nuclear program. The operation involved providing Iran with a flawed design for a nuclear weapon. The Justice Department said the information Sterling provided to the reporter was classified and that he was not authorized to disclose it. \"The unauthorized disclosure of classified information can have serious consequences for our national security,\" said U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia Neil MacBride. \"The Department of Justice will continue to investigate and prosecute those who violate their oaths and compromise our national security.\" The Justice Department said the investigation into Sterling began in 2003, when the CIA's Counterintelligence Center received information that a New York Times reporter was working on a story about Operation Merlin. The CIA launched an internal investigation and determined that Sterling was the source of the information. The Justice Department said Sterling was interviewed by the FBI in 2003 and 2004, but he denied providing the information to the reporter. The Justice Department said it was able to determine that Sterling was the source of the information after reviewing documents and conducting interviews. Sterling is the second former CIA employee to be charged with leaking classified information to the media. In 2010, former CIA officer John Kiriakou was charged with disclosing classified information to journalists. Kiriakou pleaded guilty to the charge and was", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [17.384029626846313], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1736408546.9982316}

The man was arrested in the Woolwich area of south London, where the soldier was killed on Wednesday, the Metropolitan Police said in a statement. The man was arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in custody. The soldier, who has not been named, was attacked by two men in a car and then hacked to death with a meat cleaver and knives in broad daylight. The attackers, who were filmed by a passer-by, were shot by police. The soldier was wearing a Help for Heroes T-shirt, a charity that supports wounded servicemen and women. The charity said it was \"deeply shocked and saddened\" by the attack. \"Our thoughts and prayers are with the soldier's family and friends at this very difficult time,\" it said in a statement. The attack has been condemned by British Prime Minister David Cameron, who called it a \"sickening\" and \"barbaric\" act. \"We will never buckle in the face of such violence,\" he said. \"We will never give in to terror or terrorism in any of its forms.\" The attack comes at a time of heightened tensions in Britain over the role of the military in Afghanistan.

From Friday to Monday, a total of 8,480 migrants were rescued, according to the Italian coast guard, which said it received on Monday -- alone -- SOS calls from 20 boats in distress. On Tuesday, a spokesman with Save the Children told CNN the group fears 400 migrants could be missing, citing testimony from survivors who said their ship carrying 550 people capsized in the Mediterranean Sea about 80 miles off the Libyan coast. The Italian coast guard, however, told CNN that while it is taking the report seriously, it cannot confirm such an incident and has not yet found evidence at sea to indicate a migrant boat carrying approximately 550 has capsized with 145 rescued. An operation that included boats and planes did not find any survivors, nor bodies, nor any evidence to indicate a particular boat capsized, Coast Guard official Filippo Marini said. There has been a recent upsurge in migrant boats crossing the Mediterranean into Italy and an increase in rescues performed by the Italian Coast Guard to aid migrant boats. Why migrants are dying trying to reach Italy . According to the International Organization for Migration, Italy registered more than 10,000 migrants arriving in the first three months of 2015, and about 2,000 were rescued at sea during the first weekend of April in the Channel of Sicily. Most migrants recorded this year come from countries in West Africa as well as Somalia and Syria, the IOM said. They use Libya as a country of transit. At least 480 migrants have died while crossing the Mediterranean since the beginning of the year, often because of bad weather and overcrowded vessels used by smugglers, the IOM said. Sometimes the captains and crews abandon the ships, leaving passengers to fend for themselves. Last week: 978 migrants rescued in one day in Mediterranean Sea .

The Million Women Study, a collaboration between Cancer Research UK and the NHS, results suggested that women who are using combined HRT have double the risk of breast cancer compared to non-users. And researchers found if women use HRT for more than 10 years, their risks are even higher. Now scientists involved in the Women's Health Initiative study have warned, after further follow-ups, that women who take the combined oestrogen and progesterone HRT therapy continue to have a high risk of breast cancer, up to eight years after they stop treatment. After going through the menopause a woman's ovaries stop producing the hormone oestrogen. It triggers menopausal symptoms including hot flashes and mood swings. HRT treats the body by introducing female sex hormones. There are three types, oestrogen-only HRT, cyclical HRT - where oestrogen is taken continuously but progesterone is given either monthly or every three months - and continuous combined HRT, where both female sex hormones are taken at the same time. In the early 1990s, some smaller studies suggested the therapy would reduce a woman's risk of coronary heart disease and osteoporosis. To examine whether that was the case, the Women's Health Initiative in the US was tasked with investigating. They enrolled more than 26,000 women aged 50 to 79 in the study. Meanwhile, in the UK \u00a0another key study, the Million Women Study, explored the effects of HRT on women aged 50 or over. Both concluded that women prescribed HRT were at a higher risk of breast cancer, than those not receiving the treatment.

Sat with Dr. Phil: Kim Richards is speaking out for the first time since her shocking arrest last week following a drunken altercation at The Beverly Hills Hotel . Contradicting reports: Some sources involved in production of Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills say that Kim Richard's protestations that she was sober last season were laughable - while others say she was doing better than ever . Currently, Kim is scheduled to appear at the Los Angeles Superior Court on May 10 following her April 16 incident at the Polo Lounge where she 'caused a disturbance at the hotel restaurant and was taken into custody at the Beverly Hills Police Department.' According to the Richards family friend, Kim's drunk actions were brought on after watching the three-part reunion for the seventh season, which left her 'distraught' and 'very embarrassed.' But that wasn't the only cause. Kim's ex-husband Monty Brinson - who is battling Stage IV cancer - continues to lean on her for support, which fans were able to watch on the recent RHOBH season. 'A big part of all of this is that she is just stressed out,' the pal explained. 'She is under a lot of pressure, especially because of Monty.

A pioneering facial surgeon \u2018repeatedly\u2019 punched a patient in the head in an \u2018extraordinary\u2019 attempt to correct a fracture caused by an industrial accident, a medical tribunal has heard. Professor Ninian Peckitt, 63, claimed he had simply \u2018digitally manipulated\u2019 the patient\u2019s face as part of hospital treatment, but witnesses said that in reality he had actually been hitting him, the tribunal was told. The world-renowned surgeon, who has lectured on the use of titanium implants to treat disfigured patients and has been published in academic texts, faces being struck off the medical register after being accused of failing three of his patients. A Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service hearing in Manchester was told a man referred to as Patient A had suffered \u2018extensive injuries\u2019 to the right side of his face in an industrial accident. He was admitted to Ipswich Hospital in February 2012 where Professor Peckitt was working as an honorary locum consultant in oral and maxillo-facial surgery since the previous month. Christopher Hamlet, representing the General Medical Council, told the hearing: \u2018The case is not centred around the outcome, but the method of the surgery by way of the extraordinary allegation that he repeatedly punched the patient in the face.\u2019 He added that Patient A had fallen out of bed which had further displaced his facial fractures. The hearing was told Professor Peckitt embarked on a \u2018closed reduction\u2019 procedure, in which a patient is given anaesthetic before the fractured bone is manually put back together without surgery, and a cast or splint applied. Mr Peckitt was working as an honorary locum at Ipswich Hospital in Suffolk at the time of the alleged incident in February 2012. A medical tribunal will decide whether he should be struck off the register . Professor Peckitt, formerly of Doncaster, later described the procedure as one in which the patient\u2019s face had been \u2018digitally manipulated as best they could be achieved\u2019, the hearing heard.

The ex-wife of a professional gambler and racehorse trainer has launched a bid for a bigger slice of his legacy, claiming he avoided a huge tax bill by dying. Albert Davison made a fortune by landing a series of six-figure bets on his own horses. When he died, aged 73, he owned a seven-bedroom country estate in Surrey which had been valued at \u00a34.25million. But before he died, in 2011, he and his second wife Penny Ann Davison, 59, fought a bitter battle through the divorce courts for four years over his fortune, before she was awarded just \u00a3750,000. A judge found that Mr Davison had squandered millions of his winnings through 'wasteful expenditure' and 'bad decision making.' But now his beautician ex-wife has now appeared back in court, seeking to boost her slice to more than \u00a31million by claiming his death has freed up more of his cash by allowing him to avoid a huge tax bill. Lord Justice Patten, Lord Justice Briggs and Lady Justice King, sitting at London's Appeal Court, heard that the couple met in 1989 and enjoyed a relationship for five years before marrying in 1994. They had two children before separating in 1999. Divorce proceedings were started by Mrs Davison in 2005 and the battle over the division of the matrimonial assets dragged on for four years. Mr Davison had put the family racing stables, and seven-bedroom detached former matrimonial home at Tillingdown Farm, near Woldingham, into a complex structure of offshore companies and trusts and denied that he had any stake in the property. His lawyers argued that the farm into which he had sunk his gambling fortune was all held in trust for Zoe Davison, his daughter from his first marriage, and his two children from his marriage to Mrs Davison.

The very next inning, Royals' Mike Moustakas was also hit in the arm, this time by a pitch from Chris Sale, leading to a warning for both teams.

'It seems like such an understatement to say my heart is full, but it is,' Lynch said. 'I have to thank the president for his faith in me and asking me to lead the department that I love to even greater heights.' Vice President Joe Biden administered the oath of office to Lynch at a Justice Department ceremony. Lynch replaces Eric Holder, who left the job Friday after six years as attorney general. The 55-year-old Lynch was confirmed by the Senate on Thursday following a months-long delay in which her nomination became caught up in a dispute over human trafficking legislation . 'Ladies and gentlemen, it's about time,' Biden said to applause. 'It's about time this woman is being sworn in,' he declared. 'We got tired of this wait.' 'But you showed such grace and such humility during this whole process,' he added, turning to America's newly minted top cop. Lynch paid an emotional tribute to her family during a brief speech after she took her oath. 'If a little girl from North Carolina who used to tell her grandfather in the fields to lift her up on the back of his mule so she could \"see way up high, Granddaddy\" can grow up to become the chief law enforcement officer of the United States of America, we can do anything.'

Mr Robinson's voice sounded weak and strained after his treatment for a bronchial carcinoid tumour which involved surgery to stop cancer spreading to other parts of the body. Afterwards he tweeted: 'Good to be back on air. Don't worry about the voice. It doesn't hurt and I'm not risking my recovery.' He said he was listening to his doctors and speech therapist. His return comes at a vital stage of the campaign, when the parties lay out their programmes for government to voters. The Tories' manifesto is unveiled today and the Liberal Democrats' is on Wednesday. Mr Robinson, 51, who is married with three children, has been sent an outpouring of good wishes, led by Prime Minister David Cameron. In a message recorded for the BBC website earlier yesterday, Mr Robinson said his return was a 'small step' and he did not expect to return to the campaign trail full-time at this stage. 'I'm taking my next small step back to reporting the election after my recent operation. As you can hear, my voice is still recovering and it's got a way to go yet. I'm not ready to go on the campaign trail full-time, but I will be watching this week's manifesto launches and the big opposition parties' debate on Thursday. 'I'll be blogging and I hope doing a little bit of broadcasting like this too. I would like to thank all those people who have sent me good wishes \u2013 it's really strengthened me. 'It's a fascinating election with an extraordinarily unpredictable result and I can't wait to get back to reporting it full-time, which, fingers crossed,", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [16.275193452835083], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1736408814.8466613}

One of four homes inside a 1920's building, it offers a large living room with seating, a dining area and a small but fully stocked kitchen. It is described as 'beautiful, decorated and clean' - a far cry from the squalor revealed in photographs taken when Cobain moved out in 1992, which showed graffiti on the walls and rubbish scattering every available surface. The rooms where Cobain stayed have undergone a full renovation since he lived there . Cobain moved out when Love was eight months pregnant after a leak in the bathtub damaged the guitars, music and other possessions he stored there. Since then the place has been fully renovated and much of the idol's artwork has been covered up.

But it's not that hard for us to make well people feel worse.\nArticle: (CNN) -- The freedom to test is a good thing. But it's not that hard for us to make well people feel worse.\nArticle: (CNN) -- The freedom to test is a good thing. But it's not that hard for us to make well people feel worse.  The disturbing truth is that it is hard for us to make well people feel better.  But it's not that hard for us to make them feel worse. Decades of research have shown that there are real side-effects to testing the well: more anxiety (that can't be good for your health), more procedures (which often involve needles, pain and can even lead to complications like collapsed lungs) and more treatment for \"disease\" not destined to cause problems (as in over a million additional American men treated for prostate cancer, ditto women for breast cancer).  To see how far wrong testing can go, check out South Korea: where ultrasound screening has increased the amount of thyroid cancer -- and thyroid cancer surgery -- by 15-fold. I can tell you one thing for sure, the freedom to test won't save money.  Sure, a competitive market will drive down prices for individual tests.   But advertising will drive up the volume of testing.  And then there are all the office visits and subsequent testing for the abnormal results.  This will cost people real money -- either in terms of higher insurance premiums or higher out-of-pocket costs. Maybe this kind of freedom of information isn't such a good thing. Of course, there have been genuine advances in diagnostic testing.  Diagnostic tests can be extremely useful in sorting out acute medical problems.  But if you feel well, don't think that testing will make you feel better. The biotech sector is excited about testing well people -- it's a huge market -- and is developing lots of new product.  Now you can sequence your DNA, soon you will be able to monitor your immune system's signature.  Now you can monitor your vital signs on your smartwatch, soon you will be able to test your breath for lung cancer on a phone app.  They are even impl", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [17.380107164382935], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1736408881.9030209}

In his video message the Prime Minister, who has defended the right of the Church to intervene in political debate, said Easter was ' time to reflect on the part that Christianity plays in our national life'. 'The Church is not just a collection of beautiful old buildings;  it is a living, active force doing great works across our country,' he said. 'When people are homeless, the Church is there with hot meals and shelter.  When people are addicted or in debt; when people are suffering, or grieving - the Church is there.'

The child had fallen out of the window, which had been propped open to let in the breeze, and died from his injuries. James Krainch was almost two-years-old when he toppled out of a second floor condo window and died .

'When I got to his side, he gave me one last smile and then went unconscious,' Mrs Newman told the Deseret News. On the ninth anniversary of his death Ms Newman visited her son's grave with her two other children Spencer and Kierah Krainich to celebrate the life of their brother. 'A lot of times we'll fly kites and we'll play games,' she said. 'We'll do things I think James would have liked doing with us.' James was 22 months and tumbled from the window because a screen was not strong enough to hold him . Ms Newman said James, who was 22 months old when he died, had fallen from the window as he was sat on the sofa, while she fed his younger brother who was then around six months old. The screen was not strong enough to prevent him from tumbling to the ground. Michelle Newman said she hopes by sharing her story other parents will safety proof their homes .

Paris Saint-Germain striker Ibrahimovic will now miss three games and Marseille playmaker Payet just one after both clubs succeeded with appeals to the French Olympic Committee (CNOSF). Ibrahimovic was initially banned for four games by the French Football League (LFP) when he was caught on camera after last month's 3-2 defeat to Bordeaux launching into a tirade against official Lionel Jaffredo while walking back to the dressing room. Zlatan Ibrahimovic has had his four-game ban reduced by one match after successfully appealing . Ibrahimovic was heard swearing as he walked towards the changing room after PSG's loss against Bordeaux . The Swede reacted angrily to the defeat and said it was the worst refereeing display he'd ever seen . He was angered by suggestions his remarks were also derogatory to France as a whole and claimed his words had been 'twisted'. Speaking in the video in English but in partial sentences, the Sweden international could be heard saying: 'He's an a******. Play 15 years, never seen referee this s*** country. Don't even deserve PSG should be in this country. F****** too good for all of you. Should be happy they exist.' Marseille playmaker Payet then received a two-game sanction after aiming expletives at the closed door of the match officials' dressing room following the goalless draw with Lyon, in which Lucas Ocampos' late strike was deemed not to have crossed the goal-line. A statement from OM read: 'Olympique de Marseille received on Friday an official notification that the (LFP) has accepted the proposal of the CNOSF concerning the suspension of Dimitri Payet. 'The (CNOSF) arbitrator proposed to reduce the suspension from two matches to one match with a further one-match ban suspended.' PSG initially only reported the news in a post on their Swedish Twitter account. It read: 'Now it is clear. Ibrahimovic's penalty has been shortened by one game!

The ISIS terrorist group claimed responsibility for the attack. The explosion killed at least 33 people and injured more than 100 others, public health spokesman Najibullah Kamawal said. The claim appears to be the first in Afghanistan by ISIS, CNN's Nick Paton Walsh said. It was made by an offshoot called ISIS Wilayat Khorasan. In a statement, the group said the bomber was named Abu Mohammad and he belonged to their ranks. He was targeting government workers collecting their pay at the bank, the terrorists said. He detonated his charge at the peak of rush hour on the first day of the week, when the bank would be expected to be crowded. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid, in a text message to journalists, distanced his group from the attack. \"The explosion in Jalalabad doesn't have anything to do with us and we condemn it,\" he said. ISIS refers to Afghanistan and Pakistan as the province of \"Khorasan.\" In March, CNN reported on ISIS recruiting in Afghanistan. The United Nations condemned the violence. \"The continuing use of suicide attacks in densely populated areas, that are certain to kill and maim large numbers of Afghan civilians, may amount to a war crime,\" said Nicholas Haysom, head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. The United Nations said that in the first three months of the year 655 people were killed and 1,155 were wounded in suicide attacks throughout the country. Fears about ISIS involvement in the region have been growing this year. In February, Mullah Abdul Rauf, a former Taliban commander who had become a recruiter for ISIS in Afghanistan, was killed in a drone strike, according to officials who spoke to CNN. And later that same week, Gen. John Campbell, the top U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that he was concerned about the growth of ISIS in the area. \"You do have some of the Taliban breaking", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [16.41972041130066], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1736412195.8674726}

Brelo's attorney Patrick D'Angelo conceded that his tactics could be called into question given that Brelo exposed himself to danger when he stepped onto the hood of a beat-up Chevy Malibu to fire 15 rounds into the windshield of the suspects' vehicle . But Brelo and 12 officers who shot a total of 137 rounds into the car in November 2012 had ample reason to believe that Russell and Williams were shooting at them, he said . Brelo's defense team has argued that all 49 rounds Brelo fired that night, including the last 15, were lawful . The threat from the pair didn't end until Brelo reached into the Malibu and removed the keys to prevent the suspects from using the car as a weapon, according to his defense . Russell and Williams were each shot more than 20 times . The chase started with a failed traffic stop on the edge of downtown by a plainclothes detective who never reported to dispatchers that he'd lost sight of the vehicle . Russell then sped past Cleveland police headquarters, where his car backfired . Officers and witnesses standing outside were certain they'd heard gunshots and a police radio call for shots fired triggered an adrenaline-fueled rush by officers to join the chase . Brelo and his partner were two of the first officers to join the pursuit that ultimately included more than 60 police cars, 104 officers and reached at least 100mph . After driving into a school parking lot more than 20 minutes after the chase began, Russell turned the car around and tried to flee again - sideswiping a cruiser before coming to a stop .

China's pollution hit cities are now having to cope with a fresh nuisance after the fourth massive sandstorm struck the north-west of the country this year alone. The images show the city of Golmud, in the country's north west Qinghai Province, as it succumbs to a sweeping half-hour sandstorm which reduced the visibility to as little as 30 metres, according to\u00a0The People's Daily Online. The raging sand storm sweeps in on the city of Golmud in north west China, where 200,000 people live . The sandstorm was the fourth to hit the area this year as authorities struggle to deal with the natural hazards . China's Meteorlogical Centre issued a blue alert as the sandstorms swept across the north of the country . China's National Meteorological Centre (NMC) has now issued a blue alert for the latest sandstorms to hit the northern regions. The red sand swept across the northern part of the country bringing strong winds and floating sand to the regions of Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Ningxia and Shaanxi, in what was the fourth sandstorm to hit the area this year. The organisation advised residents to stay indoors and local authorities to brace for the clean-up operation after the sandstorms. China's four-tier colour-coded weather warning system signifies red as the most severe followed by orange, yellow and blue. Photos of the city of Dunhuang in the north-western province of Gansu show the thick orange haze coating the city's atmosphere and the lack of people on the streets gave the area an almost alien planet appearance. A local meteorologist said visibility was reduced to less than 50metres in downtown areas. Police spokesman Hui Chuang said: 'The storm forced most people to stay indoors because it was difficult to drive anyway given the low visibility and also hard to breathe without inhaling sand. 'It also forced the closure of the nearby Mogao Grottoes.' The site is a UNESCO world heritage tourist site renowned", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [16.550806999206543], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1736412281.3373852}

Broga celebrates the physical over the spiritual, and strength over flexibility. Experts say it sets men free to flex tight hamstrings without hearing invocations to Hindu deities or feeling inept next to a woman twisted like a pretzel. Scroll down for video Yoga for men: From downward dog to warrior pose, Broga is becoming increasingly popular thanks to its 'rugged' approach to traditional yoga workouts Making a point: Traditionally seen as an exercise regime for women, yoga is changing and now has a more universal appeal 'I consider myself an athletic guy, but have never been flexible and didn't like the thought of embarrassing myself in front of a group of women,' said financial analyst and Broga enthusiast Eric Wright, 22, from San Jose, California. Founder: Robert Sidoti (pictured) is the creator and co-Founder of Broga Eric and his male colleagues use the video streaming service Grokker, which is aimed at broadcasting fitness, food and yoga classes directly to your home or office, to partake in their weekly yoga sessions. 'On Wednesdays we have a standing Broga appointment and anywhere from five to eight others will join me,' he said. Grokker founder and CEO Lorna Borenstein said more men are adding yoga to their exercise routines as a cross-training tool for flexibility and improving recovery time. Even if they spend most of their time focusing on more high intensity gym training, men are now using yoga as a useful warm-up method. 'Men are a little late to the party,' she said. 'But we're seeing more men in the workplace who find time to do yoga together a few times a week.' Yoga instructor Robert Sidoti, based in Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, is the creator and co-founder of the trademarked Broga Yoga, which so far has trained some 200 Broga instructors in at least 22 states.

A customer called Greg King noticed the message and posted a picture of it on his Instagram page with the hashtag #thatswhatlovelookslike - within a couple of days it had been shared thousands of times on social media. The owner told News Channel 4 that she hadn't expected it to receive such a huge response and was just trying to do the right thing. She said: 'Last week, I had noticed some bags, when I had taken out the trash, were torn open and some of the food was taken out,' 'That really, it hurt me that someone had to do that - I will not take down that sign until they come in.

A tow truck driver works to clear the scene of a multi-vehicle pileup on U.S. Highway 36, Friday near Boulder, Colo. A car is stuck under a semi tractor trailer at the scene of a multi-vehicle pileup on U.S. Highway 36 . Numerous crashes and spin outs on icy and snowy highways have closed portions of several interstates and highways in the Denver and Colorado Springs area as well as the mountains . 'My car was just sitting there on this little island on its own,' she said. 'It was pretty surreal. I feel pretty lucky today.' In Aurora, near Denver, one person died after being thrown from an Oldsmobile Bravada that lost control and rolled on an icy stretch of Interstate 225, striking a passing public bus. The only person on the bus was its driver, who wasn't hurt. Another person in the Oldsmobile was taken to a hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening, police said. Near Fort Carson, the Colorado State Patrol responded to a series of rush-hour crashes involving a total of nearly 20 cars. In the mountains, Interstate 70 was temporarily closed after several trucks spun out on snowy Vail Pass. At lower elevations, the storm left only light snow on grass, and roads were largely clear because of recent warm weather. However, motorists driving at normal speeds were surprised by icy patches, especially on bridges, said Trooper James Schmidt of the Colorado State Patrol. 'We're in Colorado. We have four seasons in one day,' Schmidt said after the", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [17.772527933120728], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1736412383.3404613}

The 22-year-old winger was signed by then Old Trafford boss Sir Alex Ferguson in January 2013 from Crystal Palace for \u00a310million. But the terms of the transfer saw him loaned straight back to the Eagles for the remainder of the season and he did not arrive at Old Trafford until the summer, by which time Ferguson had retired and been replaced by David Moyes. During a disastrous campaign for the club under Moyes, Zaha made just four United appearances before playing out the second half of last season at Cardiff. 'There is nothing worse than not being involved,' he told the Daily Telegraph. 'You are sitting there thinking 'what exactly am I? A footballer who is not playing football?' You feel a bit worthless sitting in the stands, watching all the time. You have nothing to speak about with the players. Zaha made just four appearances for Manchester United in two years with the club . 'If you have played the game then it's \"well done\" or \"you should have passed here or there\". But when you haven't played... I think people lose a bit of respect for you. I think they are thinking 'well, he's not played'. They don't have anything to speak to you about. It's a big thing.' 'There were so many rumours about me that were not true. And they hurt me because all I was doing was keeping my head down to do my best every time and then after training I'd go home and there would be something in the paper or wherever about me not having a good attitude and that's why I wasn't playing, rumours about my private life and that's why I wasn't playing, me turning up late for this, turning up late for that.' Zaha revealed the last straw came when he was left on the bench against League One outfit MK Dons as United crashed out of the Capital One Cup 4-0 last August. Eventually he spoke to new United boss Louis Van Gaal, who confirmed that he wasn't part of his first-team plans and so he headed back on a season-long loan deal to Palace, where he", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [16.385218858718872], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1736412399.7642715}

Andrew Caldwell, 21, was covered in the dessert after he was recognized by a cashier at a St. Louis FroYo store. He said the woman called him a gay slur, said that it was impossible for God to 'turn' gay people straight, and then picked up the extra large bowl from the scale at the counter and aggressively threw it in Caldwell's face. However the employee, Stephanie Diaz, says Caldwell is a liar. In an interview with the same TV station, Diaz said Caldwell demanded a discount for his yogurt. When she didn't relent, he called her a 'dog' and a 'b----', Diaz said. Diaz, who is openly gay, said it had nothing to do with the viral video. 'I threw the ice cream at him,' she said outside of the store Thursday. 'He called me a dog. \u2026 I lost it.' 'I lost it': Stephanie Diaz, who is openly gay, admits to throwing the yogurt at Caldwell, but said he is lying about his story . Scene: The incident occurred Wednesday at his FroYo store in Delmar, St.Louis . Comfortably straight: Andrew Caldwell, seen here in a recent photo from his Facebook page, happily announced last year that God had cured his homosexuality and that he had been 'delivered' CCTV footage released of the incident shows Caldwell throwing money at Diaz. That is when Diaz throws the yogurt. The FroYo store released the footage to show Caldwell was lying. Diaz said she had never seen the church video or heard of Caldwell. She has been charged with third-degree assault. However Diaz has not been fired. FroYo have said any punishment that should occur from the incident will be handled internally. Stylish: Caldwell is pictured here dressed in head-to-toe designer clothing on his Facebook page . Caldwell says he is considering suing Diaz and FroYo.

Mrs Culley\u00a0said: 'My waters had broken and my husband was on the phone to get his mum to take us to hospital. 'But by the time she got here, the baby had already been born. 'When it all started happening, Trinity turned to me and said: \"It's OK mum, I have seen One Born Every Minute. I'll go get the towels.\" 'She was just amazing.

He joined Spurs in 2011 from Manchester City, initially on loan before an impressive first season tally of 18 goals, convinced the club to make the switch permanent for \u00a35million the following summer. Since then, however, Adebayor's goal return has become significantly more modest and he has not scored in the league for Spurs since the 2-1 defeat to Newcastle back in October.

Italian Alex Bellini is to be subjected to the full force of the iceberg as it melts, cracks and even flips - while hopefully staying safe inside his small spherical cabin. The aim of the cabin fever-inducing stunt is to highlight how global warming will melt icebergs around the world and cause sea levels to rise. Scroll down for video . Italian Alex Bellini will live atop an iceberg in Greenland starting next year. He will live inside a contained ball (artist's illustration shown), with no means to escape for 12 months. The capsule will be 10ft (three metres) wide and could fit 10 people - but Mr Bellini will remove all of the seats apart from one, for himself . Mr Bellini, 36, is seeking funding for his project, called Adrift, which he hopes to begin in November 2016. Previous feats by the explorer include running more than 14,000 miles (22,500km), rowing more than 21,000 miles (34,000km) and spending 560 days in isolation. He has rowed both the Atlantic and Pacific and insists he favours challenges where there is a perceived lack of control. The capsules, initially designed essentially as escape pods for areas at risk of tsunami, can hold from two to ten people and range in price from \u00a38,000 to \u00a313,500 ($12,000 to $20,000). Four are currently in use in Japan, while two are in the US. Mr Bellini will use one at the upper scale, 10ft (three metres) wide - although he\u2019ll remove all the seats except one for himself. Inside he\u2019ll have exercise equipment, such as a stationary bike, in addition to supplies for the year such as food and water. But his latest venture represents a whole new challenge as he will have to deal with intense isolation and undergo serious psychological tests as he copes with being alone for 12 months.

The splatters of blood on the checklist for the very first US spacewalk were from an astronaut as he frantically battled to close the hatch door of the spacecraft after a historic venture. But the Gemini 4 mission of June 1965 ultimately proved successfully, and paved the way to astronauts walking on the moon for the first time four years later. A complete 13-page checklist, including a bloodstained document seen at the front), from the Gemini 4 mission in June 1965 is tipped to sell for a huge \u00a380,000 ($120,000). The list shows the various steps the astronauts had to go through when opening and closing the hatch to space . Gemini 4 launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on 3 June 1965 with two astronauts on board. One, Ed White, was tasked with performing the first US spacewalk, less than three months after Soviet Alexey Leonov had completed the first spacewalk in history. The two astronauts on the Gemini 4 mission were Jim McDivitt and Ed White. The Gemini programme of the 1960s was designed to develop and test capabilities that would ultimately land humans on the moon in the Apollo missions. The first crewed Gemini flight, Gemini 3, lifted off Launch Pad 19 at Cape Canaveral in Florida on March 23, 1965. Nasa's two-man Gemini spaceflights demonstrated that astronauts could change their capsule's orbit, remain in space for at least two weeks and work outside their spacecraft. They also pioneered rendezvous and docking with other spacecraft. All were essential skills to land on the moon and return safely to Earth. They orbited Earth 66 times over four days and, on the first day, Ed White donned a spacesuit and drifted out of the cramped capsule. He spent 20 minutes in space on the spacewalk, or extravehicular activity", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [17.924148559570312], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1736412671.575708}

The damage was just part of the destruction caused by cowboy builders who had been called in to fix a leak in the Beckle-Raymond's three bedroom property in North London. Instead, they left Phillip, his wife Gaby and their two young children, Orion and Aurielle, in an unsafe building with no roof while they ran off with \u00a317,000 of their money. Scroll down for video . Phillip and Gaby outside their London home which was left a wreck thanks to cowboy builders . 'When the builders walked out, we only had tarpaulin protecting the house throughout winter,' Gaby explains on Channel 5 show Britain's Horror Homes. 'When it rained, water started coming in, it was raining inside our house. The box room caved in, the bathroom became bowed, the ceiling will fall in the children's room. 'The most terrifying experience was the ceiling falling in the bedroom where we used to sleep. It collapsed where our bed used to be. We weren't in room at time thankfully.' For six months, the family were forced to live in one room of the house as they couldn't afford to get the problems fixed straight away, having already shelled out to the cowboy builders who left them in the lurch. Phillip, a civil servant, said: 'The house was crumbling around us, we had to turn off the lights as water was getting into electricity, it was that time of year when it was getting dark at 4pm, it was miserable. I hated leaving Gaby and the children like that when I had to go to work.' Phillip and Gaby had used all their savings to buy the property five years before for \u00a3325,000. The builders left the family with no roof and just\u00a0tarpaulin protecting the house from the winter elements. As a result, rain got into the property causing ceilings to collapse . The parents say they are devastated at being 'taken for a ride'. It will cost \u00a335,000 to repair their home . As they started a family, they worked hard to turn the house into a happy and comfortable place to raise their children.

Experts say it's an extremely good investment .\nArticle: (CNN) -- The U.S. government has been secretly collecting the telephone records of millions of U.S. customers of Verizon under a top secret court order, according to a report in the Guardian newspaper. The order, issued in April by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, requires Verizon on an \"ongoing, daily basis\" to give the National Security Agency information on all telephone calls in its systems, both within the U.S. and between the U.S. and other countries. The court order was disclosed Wednesday by the Guardian, which said it was obtained from documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. The Guardian said the order requires Verizon to provide the NSA with \"metadata\" -- such as a list of numbers involved in a call -- but not the content of the call. The newspaper said the order does not allow the government to listen in or record calls, but it does allow the agency to discover who is talking to whom. The Guardian said the order does not apply to Verizon's newFiOS service, which it said is not yet available to the majority of the company's customers. The newspaper said the order was granted under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which requires the government to obtain a warrant from the secret court to conduct surveillance. The Guardian said the order was granted on April 25 and is good until July 19.

Jack Rivera, a New York trucker, captured the collision on his dashcam as he drove along the Interstate 35E in Texas last Wednesday. Footage shows the driver of a black SUV, identified as 49-year-old Laura Michelle Mayeaux, coming off at the 397 exit and veering over to the wrong side of the lane. She then steers head-on into a truck which rolls over on its side with debris flying everywhere. As the back end of the 18-wheeler swings out, it pushes a red pickup truck off course. Thick black skid marks can be seen on the tarmac as smoke fills the air. Rivera told\u00a0waxahachietx.com\u00a0that once things came to a standstill he got out of his vehicle to see if he could offer any assistance to the parties involved before authorities arrived. The incident, which occurred just past 6pm, shut the highway for around two hours.

The Guardian said the order, issued by the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, requires Verizon on an \"ongoing, daily basis\" to give the National Security Agency information on all telephone calls in its systems, both within the U.S. and between the U.S. and other countries.

A student who tried to cheat his way to a better degree by hacking into the university computers and changing his marks has been jailed. Imran Uddin, 25, who was studying science, bought keyboard spying equipment on the internet which he then connected to a number of university computers. Through the software, which recorded key strokes, he was able to find out the passwords that staff were typing in to log in to the computers. He then used those passwords to log on to their accounts himself. After hacking into the university computer system, Uddin changed the marks that he had been given for previous assessments. On one paper, he upped his mark from 57 per cent, a lower second grade, to 73 per cent, a first. He carried out his plot using keyboard \u2018shadowing\u2019 devices which look like a USB stick and can be bought for as little as \u00a349 on the internet. He plugged these into the back of a number of staff computers at the University of Birmingham where he was studying. The device records everything which is typed into the keyboard and saves the data. Uddin, from Birmingham, was in his final year of a bio-science course. At the time of the hacking he was expected to achieve a 2:2 degree. He was jailed for four months at Birmingham Crown Court on Thursday after admitting six charges which were in breach of the Computer Misuse Act. Sentencing him, Judge James Burbridge said it was unclear why Uddin had tried to change his grades. Judge Burbridge said: \u2018For reasons not entirely clear to me, whether it was monetary, or pride, or a desire to outperform others, you decided to cheat and you formed a settled intention to do that. I consider your actions were planned and persistent.\u2019 He warned that Uddin\u2019s behaviour could have undermined public confidence in the degree system.

And when it comes to mating, this family of frogs has a unique trait not seen in other frogs. They typically like to live near fast streams and, if a pair decides to mate, they will spend five minutes searching for a private spot. \u2018The male quickly carves out a chamber by excavating the sand around small rocks at the bottom of the stream,\u2019 said Agata Blaszczak-Boxe from New Scientist. \u2018Then, like Christian Grey from Fifty Shades he invites his mate into his sex dungeon, which is only just big enough to fit the two amorous amphibians.\u2019 The amphibian, part of the Hylodes lateristrigatus group, is characterised by light stripes on its size, while it is also relatively small, according to the researchers. It was found in the Atlantic forest of Serra do Japi in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil . Once the female has laid her eggs, the male then covers up the entrance with sand from the stream. The reason for this is not only to protect the eggs from predators, but also from tadpoles of the species - as they are known to be cannibalistic. Finding the frogs wasn\u2019t easy, either - they are so secretive that the researchers had to don camouflage gear in order to observe them. A new species of glass frog (shown right) has been discovered with translucent skin so you can see its insides. The creature, named Hyalinobatrachium dianae, was found in the mountains of eastern Costa Rica and has a distinctive call.

That treble was Ronaldo's 31st career hat-trick and his 24th in La Liga, equalling Lionel Messi's record in the competition. It also took his formidable goal tally for the Bernabeu club to 299 in 287 matches. Against Granada, Ronaldo has now scored 11 times in just eight matches. But, compared with some, they have got off quite lightly. We take a look at the clubs who have suffered the most at the hands of the Portuguese wonder. Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals as Real Madrid thrashed Granada 9-1 on Sunday afternoon . The Portuguese superstar was simply irresistible as Real ran riot at the Bernabeu . SEVILLA - 18 Goals in 12 matches . There's no denying it - Ronaldo just loves playing against Sevilla, whose defence must be terrified every time they see him. Three of those La Liga hat-tricks have come against the team from Andalusia - he scored triples in a 6-2 win at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan in May 2011, a 4-1 success at the Bernabeu in February 2013 and a 7-3 thrashing in October of the same year. But they aren't even Ronaldo's best return. He scored four goals, including a 12-minute hat-trick, in another 6-2 win in Seville back in May 2011. Most recently, Ronaldo scored twice in Real's 2-0 UEFA Super Cup win over Sevilla in August.

Zinedine Zidane (with Odegaard behind him, right) dropped the Norwegian from the Castilla side this month . The young midfielder was clearly in awe of the former World Cup winning striker and simply wrote 'legend' alongside the picture on Instagram. Ronaldo, who scored more than 100 goals for Real and netted an impressive 62 international goals, was visiting his old club ahead of their Champions League quarter-final second-leg clash against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday. Odegaard opted to join Real Madrid after courting interest from a host of top clubs in Europe, including Manchester United and Liverpool, and signed a long-term \u00a340,000 a week contract with the Champions League winners in January. The former Stromgodset playmaker has trained with Carlo Ancelotti's first team regularly since his arrival, rubbing shoulder's with the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale. Odegaard is said to be on a different wave length to his Castilla team-mates because he rarely trains with them . The 16-year-old joined Real Madrid for \u00a32.3million in January signing a long-term \u00a340,000 a week contract . But the Norwegian wonderkid has found life tough at the Spanish giants in recent weeks. First team coach in waiting Zinedine Zidane dropped Odegaard from his Castilla side earlier this month after a dramatic downturn in results since his arrival. There have been suggestions that his presence in the side has riled team-mates that feel Odegaard training with the first team three times a week means he lacks cohesion in the B team. Real Madrid are desperate for the Castilla side to win promotion to the second tier of Spanish football and Zidane has to decide whether that goal is more attainable without the young talent.\nArticle: (CNN) -- A 16-year-old boy has been arrested in connection with the murder of a 17-year-old girl in the English city of Leicester, police said", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [16.389522790908813], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1736412986.7308488}

Such was the severity of her eating disorder, that the 15-year-old was admitted to hospital twice and faced rigorous counselling sessions. Today, Emma, whose decision to release the photos is supported by her mother Kim Waddington, said she wants to help other anorexia sufferers. By combating the compulsion to be skinny - and instead focusing on getting fit and building her muscle definition - she is now a healthier eight stone. Emma's mother Kim, left, said it was devastating watching her daughter face her 'horrific' ordeal . 'I wouldn't want anyone to go through what I went through,' Emma said. 'I went through hell. 'I've realised I was miserable when I'd lost weight. 'But I've learned so much from what I've been through and if my story can even help one person beat anorexia, I would be so happy. 'I'm 10 times stronger than I've ever been before.' Ms Waddington described watching her daughter battle the eating disorder as a 'horrific' ordeal. 'I felt so out of control and every day is a battle. I woke up thinking about it and would go to bed thinking about it,' she said. 'It's a monster that had taken over my daughter and we were fighting that monster every day. It was horrific watching my daughter go through it all.' Emma, from Blaby, Leicestershire, first felt the urge to lose weight after seeing pictures of celebrities in magazines. Quickly, she said, it became an obsession. She said: 'Whoever was on the front cover, I wanted to be like them. 'I became very depressed about the way I looked because I wasn't as skinny as them, I didn't want to look in the mirror anymore.' Within weeks her weight had plummeted to eight stone, but she was compelled to shed more. 'I would go online about 100 times a day, obsessively trying to find new ways of losing weight,' she said.

Caught on camera: Police in Maryland are hunting for a 'heartless' thief (seen above on CCTV footage) who stole a four-year-old boy's wheelchair in the middle of the night. Distraught: The youngster's mother left the wheelchair in the lobby of their building on Merrimac Drive, Langley Park, as usual on Sunday evening since it's easier to carry her son to their second floor apartment . Prince George's County Police have released a piece of surveillance footage which shows a person pushing the empty chair in a parking lot. They're asking anyone with information about the case to contact investigators. The film appears to show a dark-haired white male dressed in a jacket and pants. A cash reward is being offered. Commenting on the incident, Capt. Ken Humbel said: 'This family already faces challenges and shouldn't be burdened with the emotional and financial stress of the theft of this wheelchair. Flashback: The boy's mother has shared a video of her son using his chair  in a bid to trigger tip offs . 'The suspect we\u2019re looking for has no heart.'

The boy's mother has also shared a video of her son using his chair with the community in a bid to trigger tip offs. While officers search for the suspect, they're in talks with a foundation that may help find a replacement chair in the meantime. They did not say why the boy uses the wheelchair, citing privacy concerns.\nSummary: The 2016 presidential election is still more than", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [16.22513175010681], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1736413038.054604}

It predicted that numbers of deaths in Britain, which have been falling for 40 years, will start to go up and increase by 20 per cent over the next two decades. At the same time the price of a funeral is rising fast, thanks to higher costs for cremation, rising undertakers\u2019 bills as funeral firms are faced with bad debts, and the increasing fees demanded by churches. Deaths in Britain, which have been falling for 40 years, will start to go up and increase by 20 per cent over the next two decades, a report by a think tank has found (file photo) The report, prepared by an old age think tank, the International Longevity Centre-UK, and backed by insurance firm OneFamily, suggests that younger people who already feel financially hard pressed in comparison to their parents will still be under money pressure even after their deaths. Younger people are finding it increasingly difficult to afford homes or to start families, and in the long-term their pensions are much less secure than those of their parents, many of whom enjoyed the generous and fast-disappearing defined benefit pension system. The report from ILC-UK to be published next week said that death rates are set to go up following a long period in which medical advances, better diet, healthier lifestyles and the growing unpopularity of smoking, and the decline of dangerous heavy industrial jobs, have meant fewer people have been dying despite a rising population. \u2018After decades of the number of deaths in the UK falling, 2015 will mark a tipping point where the historic trend starts to reverse,\u2019 it said. \u2018As the oldest of the baby boomer generation move through their later years, deaths are predicted to rise by 20 per cent.\u2019 It added: \u2018This will have significant implications for current forecasts of funeral costs and highlights a growing need for families to broach the delicate subject of end of life expenses.\u2019 A 'simple' funeral", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [16.982404470443726], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1736413072.167411}

He was wanted by Lincolnshire Police over an alleged domestic violence and assault. After fleeing his home, the 22-year-old goaded officers by sharing photographs online which showed him standing outside the force's headquarters. He was eventually arrested in November in a cafe after posing outside five different police stations over two weeks and was this week jailed for eight months. But after spending less than five months behind bars since his arrest, the 22-year-old has already been released. Last year Bee taunted officers by captioning photographs 'come catch me if you can' and bragging that he was 'always playing hide and seek'. He visited five different police stations without being apprehended and even flashing his genitals outside one. The father of one had been wanted by police for breaking a non-molestation order against his former girlfriend after showing up at her house in the middle of the night. Lincoln Crown Court heard how he had been 'threatening and abusive' towards the woman when he 'kicked her door down' last October. The father of one pictured outside Lincolnshire Police headquarters in November. He was eventually arrested in a cafe . Before his arrest Bee said he was taunting police 'as a bit of fun'. He was jailed yesterday for eight months but has been released after spending less than five months behind bars since being arrested . When police couldn't find him after the assault they released his mugshot to appeal for his whereabouts. In response, Bee took to Facebook to mock their efforts. Among pictures he shared online was one of a police officer standing in the street which he captioned 'is it me you're looking for'. He also posed outside Lincolnshire Police HQ, looking towards the camera and giving a thumbs up. In other posts he said the justice system 'is really f****d up' and bragged about buying a doughnut in Tesco without being caught. At the time, he said he was taunting police 'because it's funny.' He told reporters: 'It's really funny, I wanted to do it to show how ridiculous this all is and how they obviously aren't that bothered about me", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [16.937495470046997], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1736413089.1399746}

The information was used in a 2006 New York Times article about Operation Merlin, a CIA operation that was designed to disrupt Iran's nuclear program. The operation involved providing Iran with a flawed design for a nuclear weapon. The Justice Department said the information Sterling provided to the reporter was classified and that he was not authorized to disclose it. \"The unauthorized disclosure of classified information can have serious consequences for our national security,\" said U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia Neil MacBride. \"The Department of Justice will continue to investigate and prosecute those who violate their oaths and compromise our national security.\" The Justice Department said the investigation into Sterling began in 2003, when the CIA's Counterintelligence Center received information that a New York Times reporter was working on a story about Operation Merlin. The CIA launched an internal investigation and determined that Sterling was the source of the information. The Justice Department said Sterling was interviewed by the FBI in 2003 and 2004, but he denied providing the information to the reporter. The Justice Department said it was able to determine that Sterling was the source of the information after reviewing documents and conducting interviews. Sterling is the second former CIA employee to be charged with leaking classified information to the media. In 2010, former CIA officer John Kiriakou was charged with disclosing classified information to journalists. Kiriakou pleaded guilty to the charge and was", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [17.48414969444275], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1736413190.2650099}

The man was arrested in the Woolwich area of south London, where the soldier was killed on Wednesday, the Metropolitan Police said in a statement. The man was arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in custody. The soldier, who has not been named, was attacked by two men in a car and then hacked to death with a meat cleaver and knives in broad daylight. The attackers, who were filmed by a passer-by, were shot by police. The soldier was wearing a Help for Heroes T-shirt, a charity that supports wounded servicemen and women. The charity said it was \"deeply shocked and saddened\" by the attack. \"Our thoughts and prayers are with the soldier's family and friends at this very difficult time,\" it said in a statement. The attack has been condemned by British Prime Minister David Cameron, who called it a \"sickening\" and \"barbaric\" act. \"We will never buckle in the face of such violence,\" he said. \"We will never give in to terror or terrorism in any of its forms.\" The attack comes at a time of heightened tensions in Britain over the role of the military in Afghanistan.

From Friday to Monday, a total of 8,480 migrants were rescued, according to the Italian coast guard, which said it received on Monday -- alone -- SOS calls from 20 boats in distress. On Tuesday, a spokesman with Save the Children told CNN the group fears 400 migrants could be missing, citing testimony from survivors who said their ship carrying 550 people capsized in the Mediterranean Sea about 80 miles off the Libyan coast. The Italian coast guard, however, told CNN that while it is taking the report seriously, it cannot confirm such an incident and has not yet found evidence at sea to indicate a migrant boat carrying approximately 550 has capsized with 145 rescued. An operation that included boats and planes did not find any survivors, nor bodies, nor any evidence to indicate a particular boat capsized, Coast Guard official Filippo Marini said. There has been a recent upsurge in migrant boats crossing the Mediterranean into Italy and an increase in rescues performed by the Italian Coast Guard to aid migrant boats. Why migrants are dying trying to reach Italy . According to the International Organization for Migration, Italy registered more than 10,000 migrants arriving in the first three months of 2015, and about 2,000 were rescued at sea during the first weekend of April in the Channel of Sicily. Most migrants recorded this year come from countries in West Africa as well as Somalia and Syria, the IOM said. They use Libya as a country of transit. At least 480 migrants have died while crossing the Mediterranean since the beginning of the year, often because of bad weather and overcrowded vessels used by smugglers, the IOM said. Sometimes the captains and crews abandon the ships, leaving passengers to fend for themselves. Last week: 978 migrants rescued in one day in Mediterranean Sea .

The new findings come from experts who conducted one of the world's largest studies into the effects of HRT - used to ease the effects of menopause. The Women's Health Initiative in the US and the Million Women Study in the UK have both revealed strong evidence that HRT increases a woman's risk of breast, womb and ovarian cancers. The Million Women Study, a collaboration between Cancer Research UK and the NHS, results suggested that women who are using combined HRT have double the risk of breast cancer compared to non-users. And researchers found if women use HRT for more than 10 years, their risks are even higher. Now scientists involved in the Women's Health Initiative study have warned, after further follow-ups, that women who take the combined oestrogen and progesterone HRT therapy continue to have a high risk of breast cancer, up to eight years after they stop treatment. After going through the menopause a woman's ovaries stop producing the hormone oestrogen. It triggers menopausal symptoms including hot flashes and mood swings. HRT treats the body by introducing female sex hormones. There are three types, oestrogen-only HRT, cyclical HRT - where oestrogen is taken continuously but progesterone is given either monthly or every three months - and continuous combined HRT, where both female sex hormones are taken at the same time. In the early 1990s, some smaller studies suggested the therapy would reduce a woman's risk of coronary heart disease and osteoporosis. To examine whether that was the case, the Women's Health Initiative in the US was tasked with investigating. They enrolled more than 26,000 women aged 50 to 79 in the study. Meanwhile, in the UK \u00a0another key study, the Million Women Study, explored the effects of HRT on women aged 50 or over. Both concluded that women prescribed HRT were at a higher risk of breast cancer, than those not receiving the treatment.

I knew what I had done. The whole night is my fault. None of this would have happened if I didn\u2019t drink.' Richards - who has been to rehab three times - was charged with with public intoxication, trespassing, resisting arrest and battery on a police officer and arrested at the Beverly Hills Hotel last week. Sat with Dr. Phil: Kim Richards is speaking out for the first time since her shocking arrest last week following a drunken altercation at The Beverly Hills Hotel . Contradicting reports: Some sources involved in production of Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills say that Kim Richard's protestations that she was sober last season were laughable - while others say she was doing better than ever . Currently, Kim is scheduled to appear at the Los Angeles Superior Court on May 10 following her April 16 incident at the Polo Lounge where she 'caused a disturbance at the hotel restaurant and was taken into custody at the Beverly Hills Police Department.' According to the Richards family friend, Kim's drunk actions were brought on after watching the three-part reunion for the seventh season, which left her 'distraught' and 'very embarrassed.' But that wasn't the only cause. Kim's ex-husband Monty Brinson - who is battling Stage IV cancer - continues to lean on her for support, which fans were able to watch on the recent RHOBH season. 'A big part of all of this is that she is just stressed out,' the pal explained. 'She is under a lot of pressure, especially because of Monty. While Kim Richards staunchly defended herself during the last season of Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills - maintaining that she no longer", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [17.50365972518921], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1736413308.6788101}

A pioneering facial surgeon \u2018repeatedly\u2019 punched a patient in the head in an \u2018extraordinary\u2019 attempt to correct a fracture caused by an industrial accident, a medical tribunal has heard. Professor Ninian Peckitt, 63, claimed he had simply \u2018digitally manipulated\u2019 the patient\u2019s face as part of hospital treatment, but witnesses said that in reality he had actually been hitting him, the tribunal was told. The world-renowned surgeon, who has lectured on the use of titanium implants to treat disfigured patients and has been published in academic texts, faces being struck off the medical register after being accused of failing three of his patients. A Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service hearing in Manchester was told a man referred to as Patient A had suffered \u2018extensive injuries\u2019 to the right side of his face in an industrial accident. He was admitted to Ipswich Hospital in February 2012 where Professor Peckitt was working as an honorary locum consultant in oral and maxillo-facial surgery since the previous month. Christopher Hamlet, representing the General Medical Council, told the hearing: \u2018The case is not centred around the outcome, but the method of the surgery by way of the extraordinary allegation that he repeatedly punched the patient in the face.\u2019 He added that Patient A had fallen out of bed which had further displaced his facial fractures. The hearing was told Professor Peckitt embarked on a \u2018closed reduction\u2019 procedure, in which a patient is given anaesthetic before the fractured bone is manually put back together without surgery, and a cast or splint applied. Mr Peckitt was working as an honorary locum at Ipswich Hospital in Suffolk at the time of the alleged incident in February 2012. A medical tribunal will decide whether he should be struck off the register . Professor Peckitt, formerly of Doncaster, later described the procedure as one in which the patient\u2019s face had been \u2018digitally manipulated as best they could be achieved\u2019, the hearing heard. It was also alleged he treated Patient A without seeking advice from colleagues.

The ex-wife of a professional gambler and racehorse trainer has launched a bid for a bigger slice of his legacy, claiming he avoided a huge tax bill by dying. Albert Davison made a fortune by landing a series of six-figure bets on his own horses. When he died, aged 73, he owned a seven-bedroom country estate in Surrey which had been valued at \u00a34.25million. But before he died, in 2011, he and his second wife Penny Ann Davison, 59, fought a bitter battle through the divorce courts for four years over his fortune, before she was awarded just \u00a3750,000. A judge found that Mr Davison had squandered millions of his winnings through 'wasteful expenditure' and 'bad decision making.' But now his beautician ex-wife has now appeared back in court, seeking to boost her slice to more than \u00a31million by claiming his death has freed up more of his cash by allowing him to avoid a huge tax bill. Lord Justice Patten, Lord Justice Briggs and Lady Justice King, sitting at London's Appeal Court, heard that the couple met in 1989 and enjoyed a relationship for five years before marrying in 1994. They had two children before separating in 1999. Divorce proceedings were started by Mrs Davison in 2005 and the battle over the division of the matrimonial assets dragged on for four years. Mr Davison had put the family racing stables, and seven-bedroom detached former matrimonial home at Tillingdown Farm, near Woldingham, into a complex structure of offshore companies and trusts and denied that he had any stake in the property. His lawyers argued that the farm into which he had sunk his gambling fortune was all held in trust for Zoe Davison, his daughter from his first marriage, and his two children from his marriage to Mrs Davison. However, divorce judge, Mrs Justice Baron, ordered the trust controlling the farm to pay out a \u00a3756,", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [17.994218587875366], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1736413343.3774195}

BBC political editor Nick Robinson made a brief return to TV screens last night (pictured), although his voice sounded weak and strained following his cancer surgery . Mr Robinson's voice sounded weak and strained after his treatment for a bronchial carcinoid tumour which involved surgery to stop cancer spreading to other parts of the body. Afterwards he tweeted: 'Good to be back on air. Don't worry about the voice. It doesn't hurt and I'm not risking my recovery.' He said he was listening to his doctors and speech therapist. His return comes at a vital stage of the campaign, when the parties lay out their programmes for government to voters. The Tories' manifesto is unveiled today and the Liberal Democrats' is on Wednesday. Mr Robinson, 51, who is married with three children, has been sent an outpouring of good wishes, led by Prime Minister David Cameron. In a message recorded for the BBC website earlier yesterday, Mr Robinson said his return was a 'small step' and he did not expect to return to the campaign trail full-time at this stage.

But it's not that hard for us to make well people feel worse.\nArticle: (CNN) -- The freedom to test is a good thing. But it's not that hard for us to make well people feel worse.  The disturbing truth is that it is hard for us to make well people feel better.  But it's not that hard for us to make them feel worse. Decades of research have shown that there are real side-effects to testing the well: more anxiety (that can't be good for your health), more procedures (which often involve needles, pain and can even lead to complications like collapsed lungs) and more treatment for \"disease\" not destined to cause problems (as in over a million additional American men treated for prostate cancer, ditto women for breast cancer).  To see how far wrong testing can go, check out South Korea: where ultrasound screening has increased the amount of thyroid cancer -- and thyroid cancer surgery -- by 15-fold. I can tell you one thing for sure, the freedom to test won't save money.  Sure, a competitive market will drive down prices for individual tests.   But advertising will drive up the volume of testing.  And then there are all the office visits and subsequent testing for the abnormal results.  This will cost people real money -- either in terms of higher insurance premiums or higher out-of-pocket costs. Maybe this kind of freedom of information isn't such a good thing. Of course, there have been genuine advances in diagnostic testing.  Diagnostic tests can be extremely useful in sorting out acute medical problems.  But if you feel well, don't think that testing will make you feel better. The biotech sector is excited about testing well people -- it's a huge market -- and is developing lots of new product.

Now you can monitor your vital signs on your smartwatch, soon you will be able to test your breath for lung cancer on a phone app.  They are even impl", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [17.485729932785034], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1736413527.476289}

The 16-stone British Gas engineer, who was travelling alone, confronted Mr Phillips and his wife June, 69, about their rudeness in ignoring him when he joined their table for dinner, a court heard. The couple were knocked unconscious after he allegedly assaulted them outside their cabin. But yesterday Finlay said he only swung his arms to defend himself when Mr Phillips went for him with his crutch. He denied attacking Mrs Phillips. He claimed Mr Phillips threw a cup of cocoa in his face and hit him with the crutch when he demanded an apology. He told the court: \u2018I felt myself being struck by something sharp and I put my arms over my face to defend myself \u2013 I covered my face with my arms, I didn\u2019t want my eye poked out.\u2019 He said he swung his arms outwards and felt them connect with retired engineer Mr Phillips, from Middlesbrough. They were on board the Thomson Celebration liner off Lanzarote when the incident happened in January last year. Finlay, a Glaswegian, gave jurors at Teesside Crown Court a picture of the social pitfalls of the lone traveller when he described being snubbed in the restaurant. He said he enjoyed going to musical shows and filled his time with excursions, but dinner could be a \u2018bit awkward\u2019. He recalled joining two couples and said \u2018good evening\u2019 as he sat down. \u2018I am actually quite a shy person \u2013 it is not particularly easy for me when I meet strangers,\u2019 he added. \u2018One of the ladies opposite me said \u201cgood evening\u201d back, but the other three didn\u2019t say anything to me, which I thought was a bit awkward. I was handed a menu and realised I was going to be in the situation for the next hour or so. \u2018I then spotted", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [17.267475843429565], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1736413544.7749372}

Wang Fang, the mother of his son, added: 'What can I do now? I don't love him any more, but I do love my son.' The women have now set up an online Facebook group so they can all chat and are quickly discovering just how much he hid from them, South China Morning Post reported. The story has attracted a lot of attention on social media, with some condemning Mr Yuan's actions and others expressing admiration.

A Connecticut juvenile court judge issued a written decision Wednesday denying a motion to let the teen, identified in court documents as \"Cassandra C.,\" go home. The judge also denied a motion for visitation. The 17-year-old is in remission after nearly six months of forced chemo treatments. On March 16, Michtom tried to convince the court that she should be able to return to her mother's home because she was no longer at imminent risk of harm from her illness. Michtom and attorney Michael Taylor, who represents Cassandra's mother, Jackie Fortin, released a written statement after receiving the judge's decision Wednesday: \"We are disappointed in this ruling, not least of all because it draws a factual conclusion that is directly contradicted by the weight of the evidence. We're conferring with our clients now about next steps, including whether to take another appeal.\" Cassandra was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma in September and medical experts gave her an 85% chance of survival if treated with chemotherapy. Without it, doctors said at the time, she was likely to die within two years. She started chemotherapy in November but ran away after two days, according to court documents, when she decided she did not want to put the poison of the treatment into her body. In December, a judge ordered the young woman to be under the custody of the Connecticut Department of Children and Families. At that time, she was admitted to Connecticut Children's Medical Center in Hartford and has remained there since then. Doctors surgically implanted a port in Cassandra's chest to administer chemotherapy medications, which began in spite of legal maneuvers to halt them.

Internet companies iiNet Limited, Internode, Amnet Broadband, Dodo Services, Adam Internet and Wideband Networks were all affected by the ruling . But legals experts say even if you are hit with a legal threat there are several ways to defend the accusations, Fairfax Media reports. iiNet's former chief regulatory officer, Steve Dalby, said the letter was not proof and it would be difficult for the film's studio to prove someone downloaded it. He said those hit with legal letters should also consider whether anyone else may have had access to their network. 'They can't detect downloaders so if I downloaded it but never shared it I wouldn't be concerned about it,' Mr Dalby said. 'If they're not guilty and had an open access point that was unsecured or were very free to giving their password out to people then maybe they do have the defence that it wasn't them. 'Most of the agreements state the account holder is responsible for the use of the account but there's no formal, legal obligation for customers to secure their WiFi.' He said if a letter did show up, it was important to seek legal advice. Slaters Intellectual Property Lawyers' Anny Slater told Fairfax Media there were many avenues for people to get advice. 'As to people getting access to justice and support, this case has brought to light the situation so there are many avenues for people to get advice on a cost effective basis,' she said. 'Some might argue innocence, some might argue that they didn't understand the repercussions, some might argue that the only access to the material was this way because prices were so high.' iiNet has warned its customers to expect speculative invoicing - an 'intimidating' letter demanding significant sums of up to US$7000 for an alleged infringement, or threatening court action .

The order, issued in April by the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, requires Verizon on an \"ongoing, daily basis\" to give the National Security Agency information on all telephone calls in its systems, both within the U.S. and between the U.S. and other countries. The court order, which was granted in April and is good until July 19, requires Verizon to produce \"on an ongoing daily basis\" and in \"real time\" information such as a telephone number or the length of a call, the Guardian reported. The order does not require Verizon to provide the NSA with the content of the calls, the newspaper said. The Guardian said the order was granted under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows the government to obtain warrants to monitor the activities of foreign agents in the United States. The newspaper said it had obtained a copy of the order from documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. The Guardian said the order \"requires no individualized suspicion of wrongdoing\" by the person whose records are being examined.

That's where we want to be.' Curry led the Warriors with 34 points, hitting 13 of 25 shots and four three-pointers. All five Golden State starters scored in double figures.

The defense asserts that the Boston Marathon bombings never would have happened if it weren't for Tamerlan. They have portrayed him as obsessed with jihad, spending hours in his computer trolling al Qaeda-style websites. An uncle in Russia told the FBI that Tamerlan came there in 2012, expecting to find \"jihad in the streets.\" Magomed Kartashov was questioned by the FBI after 40 days in a Russian jail. The FBI summary report of the interview was read in court. Kartashov said his nephew asked him if he had contacts with people \"in the forest,\" as locals referred to the jihadists. Tamerlan's information came from the Internet, but he had surprisingly little knowledge of Islam, the uncle told the FBI. When he asked his nephew why he wanted to go to the forest, he responded that \"jihad was necessary today,\" Kartashov told the FBI. \"I told him to stop or he wouldn't make it to the next tree.\" Jahar, on the other hand, was portrayed in the testimony of five of his former teachers as a smart, sweet kid who worked hard and earned good grades. He was \"super kind, extremely smart, a very hard worker, really a lovely person,\" said Tracey Gordon, his fifth-grade teacher at Cambridgeport School. \"All the teachers loved him,\" said Becki Norris, who had Jahar in her seventh-grade class at Community Charter School, a middle school in Cambridge known for setting its students on the path to \"full ticket\" scholarships to good colleges. \"He was one of our top students, and one of our top athletes,\" Norris said. \"He wasn't a rebel.
