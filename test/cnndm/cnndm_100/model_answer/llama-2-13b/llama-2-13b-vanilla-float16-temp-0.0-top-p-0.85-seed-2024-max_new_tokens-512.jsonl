Mr Cameron's praise for the Church comes after he criticised bishops  for a controversial election letter calling for a 'fresh moral vision of the kind of country we want to be' which was widely seen as an attack on the Coalition's welfare cuts.

The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, has condemned certain welfare reforms as part of  a series of interventions by church leaders raising concerns about the shape of the economy. In his video message the Prime Minister, who has defended the right of the Church to intervene in political debate, said Easter was ' time to reflect on the part that Christianity plays in our national life'. 'The Church is not just a collection of beautiful old buildings;  it is a living, active force doing great works across our country,' he said. 'When people are homeless, the Church is there with hot meals and shelter.  When people are addicted or in debt; when people are suffering, or grieving - the Church is there.' 'Across Britain, Christians don't just talk about 'loving thy neighbour', they live it out ...  in faith schools, in prisons, in community groups. 'And it's for all these reasons that we should feel proud to say: this is a Christian country.

'When I got to his side, he gave me one last smile and then went unconscious,' Mrs Newman told the Deseret News. On the ninth anniversary of his death Ms Newman visited her son's grave with her two other children Spencer and Kierah Krainich to celebrate the life of their brother. 'A lot of times we'll fly kites and we'll play games,' she said. 'We'll do things I think James would have liked doing with us.' James was 22 months and tumbled from the window because a screen was not strong enough to hold him . Ms Newman said James, who was 22 months old when he died, had fallen from the window as he was sat on the sofa, while she fed his younger brother who was then around six months old. The screen was not strong enough to prevent him from tumbling to the ground. Michelle Newman said she hopes by sharing her story other parents will safety proof their homes . She added: 'I just heard a pop and I looked over my shoulder and I just saw his heels as he toppled out the window,' After he hit the ground James lost consciousness and was rushed to hospital.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic has had his four-game ban reduced by one match after successfully appealing . Ibrahimovic was heard swearing as he walked towards the changing room after PSG's loss against Bordeaux . The Swede reacted angrily to the defeat and said it was the worst refereeing display he'd ever seen . He was angered by suggestions his remarks were also derogatory to France as a whole and claimed his words had been 'twisted'. Speaking in the video in English but in partial sentences, the Sweden international could be heard saying: 'He's an a******. Play 15 years, never seen referee this s*** country. Don't even deserve PSG should be in this country. F****** too good for all of you. Should be happy they exist.' Marseille playmaker Payet then received a two-game sanction after aiming expletives at the closed door of the match officials' dressing room following the goalless draw with Lyon, in which Lucas Ocampos' late strike was deemed not to have crossed the goal-line. A statement from OM read: 'Olympique de Marseille received on Friday an official notification that the (LFP) has accepted the proposal of the CNOSF concerning the suspension of Dimitri Payet. 'The (CNOSF) arbitrator proposed to reduce the suspension from two matches to one match with a further one-match ban suspended.' PSG initially only reported the news in a post on their Swedish Twitter account. It read: 'Now it is clear. Ibrahimovic's penalty has been shortened by one game! He will be back", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [16.58435034751892], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1733639272.8210402}

The ISIS terrorist group claimed responsibility for the attack. The explosion killed at least 33 people and injured more than 100 others, public health spokesman Najibullah Kamawal said. The claim appears to be the first in Afghanistan by ISIS, CNN's Nick Paton Walsh said. It was made by an offshoot called ISIS Wilayat Khorasan. In a statement, the group said the bomber was named Abu Mohammad and he belonged to their ranks. He was targeting government workers collecting their pay at the bank, the terrorists said. He detonated his charge at the peak of rush hour on the first day of the week, when the bank would be expected to be crowded. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid, in a text message to journalists, distanced his group from the attack. \"The explosion in Jalalabad doesn't have anything to do with us and we condemn it,\" he said. ISIS refers to Afghanistan and Pakistan as the province of \"Khorasan.\" In March, CNN reported on ISIS recruiting in Afghanistan. The United Nations condemned the violence. \"The continuing use of suicide attacks in densely populated areas, that are certain to kill and maim large numbers of Afghan civilians, may amount to a war crime,\" said Nicholas Haysom, head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. The United Nations said that in the first three months of the year 655 people were killed and 1,155 were wounded in suicide attacks throughout the country. Fears about ISIS involvement in the region have been growing this year. In February, Mullah Abdul Rauf, a former Taliban commander who had become a recruiter for ISIS in Afghanistan, was killed in a drone strike, according to officials who spoke to CNN. And later that same week, Gen. John Campbell, the top U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that he was concerned about the growth of ISIS in the area. \"You do have some of the Taliban breaking", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [16.232823848724365], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1733639289.0591009}
{"model_id": "llama-2-13b", "choices": [{"turns": "Michael Brelo, 31, made his first appearance in court in Cleveland, Ohio, on Monday charged with two counts of voluntary manslaughter for the deaths of Timothy Russell, 43, and Malissa Williams, 30. He is the lone officer among the 13 who fired their weapons that night who is charged criminally because prosecutors say he stood on the hood and opened fire four seconds after the other officers had stopped shooting. Brelo's attorney Patrick D'Angelo conceded that his tactics could be called into question given that Brelo exposed himself to danger when he stepped onto the hood of a beat-up Chevy Malibu to fire 15 rounds into the windshield of the suspects' vehicle. But Brelo and 12 officers who shot a total of 137 rounds into the car in November 2012 had ample reason to believe that Russell and Williams were shooting at them, he said. Self defense? Michael Brelo's attorney opened the case insisting the 31-year-old (pictured today) had reason to believe he was being shot at when he jumped on the car and shot dead Timothy Russell and Melissa Williams . D'Angelo said he wasn't calling what Brelo and the other officers did that night heroic. 'They are simple, ordinary people who try to do the best they can and are put in very dangerous situations,' he said. Brelo, charged with voluntary manslaughter, is the only officer charged because prosecutors said he waited until after the initial salvo had ended to reload and discharge the last of the 49 rounds he fired that night. A judge will decide whether Brelo is guilty or innocent. He faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison if convicted. Assistant Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Rick Bell revealed that experts have concluded that another officer fired three rounds during Brelo's 15-shot volley, something defense attorneys have argued in motions. Bell said a medical examiner has concluded that Brelo fired 'kill shots' into Russell and Williams and that they were still alive when Brelo fired from the top of a police cruiser and the trunk of the Malibu, striking Williams 11 times and Russell six times, when", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [18.37101674079895], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1733639307.4374878}

The Solar Probe Plus mission will be the first spacecraft to fly into the sun's atmosphere, or corona, and study the solar wind, a stream of charged particles that flows outward from the sun. The probe will also study the sun's magnetic field, which is responsible for the solar wind. The mission is scheduled to launch in 2018. \"The sun is the ultimate source of energy for life on Earth,\" said Nicola Fox, project scientist for the mission at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"But it also wreaks havoc on our technology, from disrupting radio communications to interfering with GPS signals.\" The sun's magnetic field is constantly changing, and those changes can have a big impact on Earth. For example, the sun's magnetic field can cause the Earth's magnetic field to weaken, which can lead to more radiation reaching the Earth's surface. The sun's magnetic field can also cause the Earth's atmosphere to heat up, which can lead to more extreme weather events.

'On Wednesdays we have a standing Broga appointment and anywhere from five to eight others will join me,' he said. Grokker founder and CEO Lorna Borenstein said more men are adding yoga to their exercise routines as a cross-training tool for flexibility and improving recovery time.

Lisa Lai told the Daily Camera newspaper she avoided hitting a crash in front of her and ended up propped against a highway barrier \u2014 and out of the way \u2014 as other peoples' vehicles piled up.

A car is stuck under a semi tractor trailer at the scene of a multi-vehicle pileup  on U.S. Highway 36 . Numerous crashes and spin outs on icy and snowy highways have closed portions of several interstates and highways in the Denver and Colorado Springs area as well as the mountains . 'My car was just sitting there on this little island on its own,' she said. 'It was pretty surreal. I feel pretty lucky today.' In Aurora, near Denver, one person died after being thrown from an Oldsmobile Bravada that lost control and rolled on an icy stretch of Interstate 225, striking a passing public bus. The only person on the bus was its driver, who wasn't hurt. Another person in the Oldsmobile was taken to a hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening, police said. Near Fort Carson, the Colorado State Patrol responded to a series of rush-hour crashes involving a total of nearly 20 cars. In the mountains, Interstate 70 was temporarily closed after several trucks spun out on snowy Vail Pass. At lower elevations, the storm left only light snow on grass, and roads were largely clear because of recent warm weather. However, motorists driving at normal speeds were surprised by icy patches, especially on bridges, said Trooper James Schmidt of the Colorado State Patrol. 'We're in Colorado.

{"model_id": "llama-2-13b", "choices": [{"turns": "Wilfried Zaha has admitted he felt 'worthless' during his two-year spell as a Manchester United player after his dream move to Old Trafford turned sour. The 22-year-old winger was signed by then Old Trafford boss Sir Alex Ferguson in January 2013 from Crystal Palace for \u00a310million. But the terms of the transfer saw him loaned straight back to the Eagles for the remainder of the season and he did not arrive at Old Trafford until the summer, by which time Ferguson had retired and been replaced by David Moyes. During a disastrous campaign for the club under Moyes, Zaha made just four United appearances before playing out the second half of last season at Cardiff. 'There is nothing worse than not being involved,' he told the Daily Telegraph. 'You are sitting there thinking 'what exactly am I? A footballer who is not playing football?' You feel a bit worthless sitting in the stands, watching all the time. You have nothing to speak about with the players. Zaha made just four appearances for Manchester United in two years with the club . 'If you have played the game then it's \"well done\" or \"you should have passed here or there\". But when you haven't played... I think people lose a bit of respect for you. I think they are thinking 'well, he's not played'. They don't have anything to speak to you about. It's a big thing.' 'There were so many rumours about me that were not true. And they hurt me because all I was doing was keeping my head down to do my best every time and then after training I'd go home and there would be something in the paper or wherever about me not having a good attitude and that's why I wasn't playing, rumours about my private life and that's why I wasn't playing, me turning up late for this, turning up late for that.'

Andrew Caldwell, 21, was covered in the dessert after he was recognized by the cashier at the Delmar store in St. Louis, Missouri. He said the woman called him a gay slur, said that it was impossible for God to 'turn' gay people straight, and then picked up the extra large bowl from the scale at the counter and aggressively threw it in Caldwell's face. However the employee, Stephanie Diaz, says Caldwell is a liar. In an interview with the same TV station, Diaz said Caldwell demanded a discount for his yogurt. When she didn't relent, he called her a 'dog' and a 'b----', Diaz said. Diaz, who is openly gay, said it had nothing to do with the viral video. 'I threw the ice cream at him,' she said outside of the store Thursday. 'He called me a dog. \u2026 I lost it.' 'I lost it': Stephanie Diaz, who is openly gay, admits to throwing the yogurt at Caldwell, but said he is lying about his story . Scene: The incident occurred Wednesday at his FroYo store in Delmar, St.Louis . Comfortably straight: Andrew Caldwell, seen here in a recent photo from his Facebook page, happily announced last year that God had cured his homosexuality and that he had been 'delivered' CCTV footage released of the incident shows Caldwell throwing money at Diaz. That is when Diaz throws the yogurt. The FroYo store released the footage to show Caldwell was lying. Diaz said she had never seen the church video or heard of Caldwell.

Adebayor has one year left to run on his current contract at White Hart Lane, but his inconsistent form has led to few assurances over his future. Maverick Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor performs a strange dance in front of the Arc de Triomphe . The Togo international posted the video of him dancing in front of the Paris landmark on his Instagram account . He joined Spurs in 2011 from Manchester City, initially on loan before an impressive first season tally of 18 goals, convinced the club to make the switch permanent for \u00a35million the following summer. Since then, however, Adebayor's goal return has become significantly more modest and he has not scored in the league for Spurs since the 2-1 defeat to Newcastle back in October. Factor in the remarkable rise of academy graduate Harry Kane and it is easy to see why some sections of supporters have written Adebayor off as surplus to requirements. Adebayor has only one year left to run on his current contract at Tottenham and could leave this summer .

Timothy Eli Thompson was born premature on March 4 without any nasal passages or sinus cavities, a condition so rare it only has a one in 197 million chance of happening. His mother Brandi McGlathery said Facebook removed a photo of her son a pro-life group tried to post to promote Eli's story. Scroll down for video . Timothy Eli Thompson was born without a nose in March in Alabama and his mom put his photo on Facebook . A picture of Eli was removed by Facebook after a pro-life group tried to post it to promote his story . The story was shared 30,000 times in six hours and the ban was lifted after complaints, WKRG reported. Brandi said: 'I posted the status with a link about it saying no one's going to keep me from posting photos of my child. 'If I can see completely distasteful things on Facebook all day long, then I can post a picture of my son. 'He was everywhere and he broke the internet!' Eli's parents, Brandi McGlathery (left) and Troy Thompson (right) are raising money for him on GoFundMe . Eli had to undergo a tracheotomy at only five days old. Doctors hope to be able to drill nasal passages in Eli's skull which will allow him to breathe when he is older. A family friend set up a GoFundMe page to help Eli's parents pay for his care. Brandi wrote: 'He will have to have a tracheoomy & a feeding bag inserted into his stomach, which is also not what I expected. 'I would be so grateful for anything anyone could spare, but if you cannot afford to help with money I will be just as appreciative for prayers for my sweet Eli. 'He has a long road a head of him & we need all the support we can get.' Doctors hope to be able to drill nasal passages in Eli's skull when he's older which will allow him to breathe . After he was born, Eli was treated at the USA Children's and Women's Hospital in Mobile for three weeks.

The justices ruled 5-4 that the law's requirement that most Americans obtain health insurance is constitutional. The court's decision means that the law's individual mandate will remain in place. The court also ruled that the law's expansion of Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor, is constitutional. But the justices said that the federal government cannot withhold all of its Medicaid funding from states that do not comply with the expansion. The court's ruling means that the law's individual mandate will remain in place. The court's decision was a major victory for President Barack Obama, who has made health care reform a centerpiece of his presidency. The law, which was signed in March 2010, is designed to expand health insurance coverage to more than 30 million uninsured Americans. The law's opponents, including the National Federation of Independent Business, argued that the individual mandate was unconstitutional because it required people to buy a product, health insurance, from a private company. The law's supporters, including the Obama administration, argued that the individual mandate was necessary to ensure that healthy people also buy insurance, which helps keep premiums down for everyone.

Italian Alex Bellini is to be subjected to the full force of the iceberg as it melts, cracks and even flips - while hopefully staying safe inside his small spherical cabin. The aim of the cabin fever-inducing stunt is to highlight how global warming will melt icebergs around the world and cause sea levels to rise. Scroll down for video . Italian Alex Bellini will live atop an iceberg in Greenland starting next year. He will live inside a contained ball (artist's illustration shown), with no means to escape for 12 months. The capsule will be 10ft (three metres) wide and could fit 10 people - but Mr Bellini will remove all of the seats apart from one, for himself . Mr Bellini, 36, is seeking funding for his project, called Adrift, which he hopes to begin in November 2016. Previous feats by the explorer include running more than 14,000 miles (22,500km), rowing more than 21,000 miles (34,000km) and spending 560 days in isolation. He has rowed both the Atlantic and Pacific and insists he favours challenges where there is a perceived lack of control. The capsules, initially designed essentially as escape pods for areas at risk of tsunami, can hold from two to ten people and range in price from \u00a38,000 to \u00a313,500 ($12,000 to $20,000). Four are currently in use in Japan, while two are in the US. Mr Bellini will use one at the upper scale, 10ft (three metres) wide - although he\u2019ll remove all the seats except one for himself. Inside he\u2019ll have exercise equipment, such as a stationary bike, in addition to supplies for the year such as food and water. But his latest venture represents a whole new challenge as he will have to deal with intense isolation and undergo serious psychological tests as he copes with being alone for 12 months.

The splatters of blood on the checklist for the very first US spacewalk were from an astronaut as he frantically battled to close the hatch door of the spacecraft after a historic venture. But the Gemini 4 mission of June 1965 ultimately proved successfully, and paved the way to astronauts walking on the moon for the first time four years later. A complete 13-page checklist, including a bloodstained document seen at the front), from the Gemini 4 mission in June 1965 is tipped to sell for a huge \u00a380,000 ($120,000). The list shows the various steps the astronauts had to go through when opening and closing the hatch to space . Gemini 4 launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on 3 June 1965 with two astronauts on board. One, Ed White, was tasked with performing the first US spacewalk, less than three months after Soviet Alexey Leonov had completed the first spacewalk in history. The two astronauts on the Gemini 4 mission were Jim McDivitt and Ed White. The Gemini programme of the 1960s was designed to develop and test capabilities that would ultimately land humans on the moon in the Apollo missions. The first crewed Gemini flight, Gemini 3, lifted off Launch Pad 19 at Cape Canaveral in Florida on March 23, 1965. Nasa's two-man Gemini spaceflights demonstrated that astronauts could change their capsule's orbit, remain in space for at least two weeks and work outside their spacecraft. They also pioneered rendezvous and docking with other spacecraft. All were essential skills to land on the moon and return safely to Earth. They orbited Earth 66 times over four days and, on the first day, Ed White donned a spacesuit and drifted out of the cramped capsule. He spent 20 minutes in space on the spacewalk, or extravehicular activity", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [17.73070192337036], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1733639758.0639186}

The site is about 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas.

The damage was just part of the destruction caused by cowboy builders who had been called in to fix a leak in the Beckle-Raymond's three bedroom property in North London. Instead, they left Phillip, his wife Gaby and their two young children, Orion and Aurielle, in an unsafe building with no roof while they ran off with \u00a317,000 of their money. Scroll down for video . Phillip and Gaby outside their London home which was left a wreck thanks to cowboy builders . 'When the builders walked out, we only had tarpaulin protecting the house throughout winter,' Gaby explains on Channel 5 show Britain's Horror Homes. 'When it rained, water started coming in, it was raining inside our house. The box room caved in, the bathroom became bowed, the ceiling will fall in the children's room. 'The most terrifying experience was the ceiling falling in the bedroom where we used to sleep. It collapsed where our bed used to be. We weren't in room at time thankfully.' For six months, the family were forced to live in one room of the house as they couldn't afford to get the problems fixed straight away, having already shelled out to the cowboy builders who left them in the lurch. Phillip, a civil servant, said: 'The house was crumbling around us, we had to turn off the lights as water was getting into electricity, it was that time of year when it was getting dark at 4pm, it was miserable. I hated leaving Gaby and the children like that when I had to go to work.' Phillip and Gaby had used all their savings to buy the property five years before for \u00a3325,000. The builders left the family with no roof and just\u00a0tarpaulin protecting the house from the winter elements. As a result, rain got into the property causing ceilings to collapse .

Footage shows the driver of a black SUV, identified as 49-year-old Laura Michelle Mayeaux, coming off at the 397 exit and veering over to the wrong side of the lane. She then steers head-on into a truck which rolls over on its side with debris flying everywhere. As the back end of the 18-wheeler swings out, it pushes a red pickup truck off course. Thick black skid marks can be seen on the tarmac as smoke fills the air. Rivera told\u00a0waxahachietx.com\u00a0that once things came to a standstill he got out of his vehicle to see if he could offer any assistance to the parties involved before authorities arrived. The incident, which occurred just past 6pm, shut the highway for around two hours. Mayeaux, from Waco, Texas, was transported to Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas because of the injuries she sustained during the wreck.

Federici tries desperately to stop the ball going over the line after it rolled through his legs and out of his grasp . 'When he comes into training we'll have a little chat but he'll be fine. He's a professional.' The incident was reminiscent of Robert Green's error in England's 2010 World Cup opener against the USA, when Clint Dempsey's strike got through him.

He then used those passwords to log on to their accounts himself . After hacking into the university computer system, Uddin changed the marks that he had been given for previous assessments .

He plugged these into the back of a number of staff computers at the University of Birmingham where he was studying . The device records everything which is typed into the keyboard and saves the data . Uddin, from Birmingham, was in his final year of a bio-science course . At the time of the hacking he was expected to achieve a 2:2 degree . He was jailed for four months at Birmingham Crown Court on Thursday after admitting six charges which were in breach of the Computer Misuse Act . Sentencing him, Judge James Burbridge said it was unclear why Uddin had tried to change his grades .

But add a touch of satin to it like Gwyneth Paltrow in her Alexander Wang version, and it goes from drab to deluxe in the blink of an eye. The Goop creator made hers a monochrome look by teaming the blush jacket with a flesh toned sweater dress underneath. The silken topper is great for an evening out and can be paired with cigarette trousers and strappy sandals for an elegant take on the menswear trend. Gwyneth's threads are from a few seasons back, so it's no longer available in stores. But our style edit is filled with lustrous alternatives from Missguided to Forever 21.

Robert Fidler, 66, secretly constructed the mock-Tudor castle complete with battlements and cannons and lived there with his family from 2002 . He unveiled it officially in 2006 when he thought he would be able to exploit a legal loophole that prevents enforcement action against a structure if no objections have been made for at least four years . But the local authority immediately laid siege by refusing to grant retrospective permission . Now, after numerous court appearances costing tens of thousands of pounds, Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles has finally ruled the four-bedroom home on Green Belt land at Honeycrocks Farm in Salfords, Surrey - worth well in excess of \u00a31million if sold on the open market - must be pulled down within 90 days . Mr Fidler yesterday compared the situation to an artist being made to destroy a piece of work . He added: 'I don't think I have any choice, to be honest. What they're saying now is if I don't demolish it in 90 days they'll put me in prison' . Mr Fidler started as a tenant farmer at Honeycrock Farm in the 1970s and bought the farmyard and ten acres of land in 1985 . There was no farmhouse, however, so from 2000 he began building the house around two grain silos at a cost of \u00a350,000 . Features include weathered brick and stone, carved wooden pillars and beams and a stained-glass dome above the stairwell . Mr Fidler and his wife, Linda, went to such lengths to hoodwink locals and the authorities that they kept their son Harry, now 14, off playschool on the day his class were due to paint scenes of their homes . 'We couldn't have him drawing a big blue haystack - people might have asked questions,' Mrs Fidler explained previously .

Males and females typically find a spot to mate in about five minutes. And the male will cover up the eggs to protect them from predators. Shown is another torrent frog, the Waterfall frog . The new species of torrent frog, reported by New Scientist, is called Hylodes japi. The amphibian, part of the Hylodes lateristrigatus group, is characterised by light stripes on its size, while it is also relatively small, according to the researchers. And when it comes to mating, this family of frogs has a unique trait not seen in other frogs. They typically like to live near fast streams and, if a pair decides to mate, they will spend five minutes searching for a private spot. \u2018The male quickly carves out a chamber by excavating the sand around small rocks at the bottom of the stream,\u2019 said Agata Blaszczak-Boxe from New Scientist. \u2018Then, like Christian Grey from Fifty Shades he invites his mate into his sex dungeon, which is only just big enough to fit the two amorous amphibians.\u2019 The amphibian, part of the Hylodes lateristrigatus group, is characterised by light stripes on its size, while it is also relatively small, according to the researchers. It was found in the Atlantic forest of Serra do Japi in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil . Once the female has laid her eggs, the male then covers up the entrance with sand from the stream. The reason for this is not only to protect the eggs from predators, but also from tadpoles of the species - as they are known to be cannibalistic. Finding the frogs wasn\u2019t easy, either - they are so secretive that the researchers had to don camouflage gear in order to observe them. A new species of glass frog (shown right) has been discovered with translucent skin so you can see its insides. The creature, named Hyalinobatrachium dianae, was found in the mountains of eastern Costa Rica and has a distinctive call.

Mr Cameron took a break from the campaign trail to visit the orphaned lambs in the nearby farm in his constituency . Mr Cameron was taken t visit the lambs with farmer Julian Tustian at Dean Lane farm just outside the village of Chadlington . The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, has condemned certain welfare reforms as part of  a series of interventions by church leaders raising concerns about the shape of the economy. In his video message the Prime Minister, who has defended the right of the Church to intervene in political debate, said Easter was ' time to reflect on the part that Christianity plays in our national life'. 'The Church is not just a collection of beautiful old buildings;  it is a living, active force doing great works across our country,' he said. 'When people are homeless, the Church is there with hot meals and shelter.  When people are addicted or in debt; when people are suffering, or grieving - the Church is there.' 'Across Britain, Christians don't just talk about 'loving thy neighbour', they live it out ...  in faith schools, in prisons, in community groups. 'And it's for all these reasons that we should feel proud to say: this is a Christian country. 'Yes, we are a nation that embraces, welcomes and accepts all faiths and none  but we are still a Christian country.' Prime Minister David Cameron said Easter was 'time to reflect on the part that Christianity plays' in the UK .

The child had fallen out of the window, which had been propped open to let in the breeze, and died from his injuries.

'When I got to his side, he gave me one last smile and then went unconscious,' Mrs Newman told the Deseret News. On the ninth anniversary of his death Ms Newman visited her son's grave with her two other children Spencer and Kierah Krainich to celebrate the life of their brother. 'A lot of times we'll fly kites and we'll play games,' she said. 'We'll do things I think James would have liked doing with us.' James was 22 months and tumbled from the window because a screen was not strong enough to hold him . Ms Newman said James, who was 22 months old when he died, had fallen from the window as he was sat on the sofa, while she fed his younger brother who was then around six months old. The screen was not strong enough to prevent him from tumbling to the ground. Michelle Newman said she hopes by sharing her story other parents will safety proof their homes .

Paris Saint-Germain striker Ibrahimovic will now miss three games and Marseille playmaker Payet just one after both clubs succeeded with appeals to the French Olympic Committee (CNOSF). Ibrahimovic was initially banned for four games by the French Football League (LFP) when he was caught on camera after last month's 3-2 defeat to Bordeaux launching into a tirade against official Lionel Jaffredo while walking back to the dressing room. Zlatan Ibrahimovic has had his four-game ban reduced by one match after successfully appealing . Ibrahimovic was heard swearing as he walked towards the changing room after PSG's loss against Bordeaux . The Swede reacted angrily to the defeat and said it was the worst refereeing display he'd ever seen . He was angered by suggestions his remarks were also derogatory to France as a whole and claimed his words had been 'twisted'. Speaking in the video in English but in partial sentences, the Sweden international could be heard saying: 'He's an a******. Play 15 years, never seen referee this s*** country. Don't even deserve PSG should be in this country. F****** too good for all of you. Should be happy they exist.' Marseille playmaker Payet then received a two-game sanction after aiming expletives at the closed door of the match officials' dressing room following the goalless draw with Lyon, in which Lucas Ocampos' late strike was deemed not to have crossed the goal-line. A statement from OM read: 'Olympique de Marseille received on Friday an official notification that the (LFP) has accepted the proposal of the CNOSF concerning the suspension of Dimitri Payet. 'The (CNOSF) arbitrator proposed to reduce the suspension from two matches to one match with a further one-match ban suspended.' PSG initially only reported the news in a post on their Swedish Twitter account. It read: 'Now it is clear. Ibrahimovic's penalty has been shortened by one game!

The ISIS terrorist group claimed responsibility for the attack. The explosion killed at least 33 people and injured more than 100 others, public health spokesman Najibullah Kamawal said. The claim appears to be the first in Afghanistan by ISIS, CNN's Nick Paton Walsh said. It was made by an offshoot called ISIS Wilayat Khorasan. In a statement, the group said the bomber was named Abu Mohammad and he belonged to their ranks. He was targeting government workers collecting their pay at the bank, the terrorists said. He detonated his charge at the peak of rush hour on the first day of the week, when the bank would be expected to be crowded. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid, in a text message to journalists, distanced his group from the attack. \"The explosion in Jalalabad doesn't have anything to do with us and we condemn it,\" he said. ISIS refers to Afghanistan and Pakistan as the province of \"Khorasan.\" In March, CNN reported on ISIS recruiting in Afghanistan. The United Nations condemned the violence. \"The continuing use of suicide attacks in densely populated areas, that are certain to kill and maim large numbers of Afghan civilians, may amount to a war crime,\" said Nicholas Haysom, head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. The United Nations said that in the first three months of the year 655 people were killed and 1,155 were wounded in suicide attacks throughout the country. Fears about ISIS involvement in the region have been growing this year. In February, Mullah Abdul Rauf, a former Taliban commander who had become a recruiter for ISIS in Afghanistan, was killed in a drone strike, according to officials who spoke to CNN. And later that same week, Gen. John Campbell, the top U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that he was concerned about the growth of ISIS in the area. \"You do have some of the Taliban breaking", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [16.239020586013794], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1733684216.8115368}

He is the lone officer among the 13 who fired their weapons that night who is charged criminally because prosecutors say he stood on the hood and opened fire four seconds after the other officers had stopped shooting. Brelo's attorney Patrick D'Angelo conceded that his tactics could be called into question given that Brelo exposed himself to danger when he stepped onto the hood of a beat-up Chevy Malibu to fire 15 rounds into the windshield of the suspects' vehicle. But Brelo and 12 officers who shot a total of 137 rounds into the car in November 2012 had ample reason to believe that Russell and Williams were shooting at them, he said. Self defense? Michael Brelo's attorney opened the case insisting the 31-year-old (pictured today) had reason to believe he was being shot at when he jumped on the car and shot dead Timothy Russell and Melissa Williams . D'Angelo said he wasn't calling what Brelo and the other officers did that night heroic. 'They are simple, ordinary people who try to do the best they can and are put in very dangerous situations,' he said. Brelo, charged with voluntary manslaughter, is the only officer charged because prosecutors said he waited until after the initial salvo had ended to reload and discharge the last of the 49 rounds he fired that night. A judge will decide whether Brelo is guilty or innocent. He faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison if convicted. Assistant Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Rick Bell revealed that experts have concluded that another officer fired three rounds during Brelo's 15-shot volley, something defense attorneys have argued in motions. Bell said a medical examiner has concluded that Brelo fired 'kill shots' into Russell and Williams and that they were still alive when Brelo fired from the top of a police cruiser and the trunk of the Malibu, striking Williams 11 times and Russell six times, when", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [18.373327255249023], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1733684235.2530391}

The Solar Probe Plus mission will be the first spacecraft to fly into the sun's atmosphere, or corona, and study the solar wind, a stream of charged particles that flows outward from the sun. The probe will also study the sun's magnetic field, which is responsible for the solar wind. The mission is scheduled to launch in 2018. \"The sun is the ultimate source of energy for life on Earth,\" said Nicola Fox, project scientist for the mission at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"But it also wreaks havoc on our technology, from disrupting radio communications to interfering with GPS signals.\" The sun's magnetic field is constantly changing, and those changes can have a big impact on Earth. For example, the sun's magnetic field can cause the Earth's magnetic field to weaken, which can lead to more radiation reaching the Earth's surface. The sun's magnetic field can also cause the Earth's atmosphere to heat up, which can lead to more extreme weather events.

Founder: Robert Sidoti (pictured) is the creator and co-Founder of Broga Eric and his male colleagues use the video streaming service Grokker, which is aimed at broadcasting fitness, food and yoga classes directly to your home or office, to partake in their weekly yoga sessions. 'On Wednesdays we have a standing Broga appointment and anywhere from five to eight others will join me,' he said. Grokker founder and CEO Lorna Borenstein said more men are adding yoga to their exercise routines as a cross-training tool for flexibility and improving recovery time. Even if they spend most of their time focusing on more high intensity gym training, men are now using yoga as a useful warm-up method. 'Men are a little late to the party,' she said.

No serious injuries were reported in the crashes on U.S. Highway 36 between Boulder and Denver, but tow-truck drivers were kept busy hauling away damaged cars. Lisa Lai told the Daily Camera newspaper she avoided hitting a crash in front of her and ended up propped against a highway barrier \u2014 and out of the way \u2014 as other peoples' vehicles piled up.

A car is stuck under a semi tractor trailer at the scene of a multi-vehicle pileup  on U.S. Highway 36 . Numerous crashes and spin outs on icy and snowy highways have closed portions of several interstates and highways in the Denver and Colorado Springs area as well as the mountains . 'My car was just sitting there on this little island on its own,' she said. 'It was pretty surreal. I feel pretty lucky today.' In Aurora, near Denver, one person died after being thrown from an Oldsmobile Bravada that lost control and rolled on an icy stretch of Interstate 225, striking a passing public bus. The only person on the bus was its driver, who wasn't hurt. Another person in the Oldsmobile was taken to a hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening, police said. Near Fort Carson, the Colorado State Patrol responded to a series of rush-hour crashes involving a total of nearly 20 cars. In the mountains, Interstate 70 was temporarily closed after several trucks spun out on snowy Vail Pass. At lower elevations, the storm left only light snow on grass, and roads were largely clear because of recent warm weather. However, motorists driving at normal speeds were surprised by icy patches, especially on bridges, said Trooper James Schmidt of the Colorado State Patrol. 'We're in Colorado.

{"model_id": "llama-2-13b", "choices": [{"turns": "Wilfried Zaha has admitted he felt 'worthless' during his two-year spell as a Manchester United player after his dream move to Old Trafford turned sour. The 22-year-old winger was signed by then Old Trafford boss Sir Alex Ferguson in January 2013 from Crystal Palace for \u00a310million. But the terms of the transfer saw him loaned straight back to the Eagles for the remainder of the season and he did not arrive at Old Trafford until the summer, by which time Ferguson had retired and been replaced by David Moyes. During a disastrous campaign for the club under Moyes, Zaha made just four United appearances before playing out the second half of last season at Cardiff. 'There is nothing worse than not being involved,' he told the Daily Telegraph. 'You are sitting there thinking 'what exactly am I? A footballer who is not playing football?' You feel a bit worthless sitting in the stands, watching all the time. You have nothing to speak about with the players. Zaha made just four appearances for Manchester United in two years with the club . 'If you have played the game then it's \"well done\" or \"you should have passed here or there\". But when you haven't played... I think people lose a bit of respect for you. I think they are thinking 'well, he's not played'. They don't have anything to speak to you about. It's a big thing.' 'There were so many rumours about me that were not true. And they hurt me because all I was doing was keeping my head down to do my best every time and then after training I'd go home and there would be something in the paper or wherever about me not having a good attitude and that's why I wasn't playing, rumours about my private life and that's why I wasn't playing, me turning up late for this, turning up late for that.'

Andrew Caldwell, 21, was covered in the dessert after he was recognized by the cashier at the Delmar store in St. Louis, Missouri. He said the woman called him a gay slur, said that it was impossible for God to 'turn' gay people straight, and then picked up the extra large bowl from the scale at the counter and aggressively threw it in Caldwell's face. However the employee, Stephanie Diaz, says Caldwell is a liar. In an interview with the same TV station, Diaz said Caldwell demanded a discount for his yogurt. When she didn't relent, he called her a 'dog' and a 'b----', Diaz said. Diaz, who is openly gay, said it had nothing to do with the viral video. 'I threw the ice cream at him,' she said outside of the store Thursday. 'He called me a dog. \u2026 I lost it.' 'I lost it': Stephanie Diaz, who is openly gay, admits to throwing the yogurt at Caldwell, but said he is lying about his story . Scene: The incident occurred Wednesday at his FroYo store in Delmar, St.Louis . Comfortably straight: Andrew Caldwell, seen here in a recent photo from his Facebook page, happily announced last year that God had cured his homosexuality and that he had been 'delivered' CCTV footage released of the incident shows Caldwell throwing money at Diaz. That is when Diaz throws the yogurt. The FroYo store released the footage to show Caldwell was lying. Diaz said she had never seen the church video or heard of Caldwell.

Adebayor has one year left to run on his current contract at White Hart Lane, but his inconsistent form has led to few assurances over his future. Maverick Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor performs a strange dance in front of the Arc de Triomphe . The Togo international posted the video of him dancing in front of the Paris landmark on his Instagram account . He joined Spurs in 2011 from Manchester City, initially on loan before an impressive first season tally of 18 goals, convinced the club to make the switch permanent for \u00a35million the following summer. Since then, however, Adebayor's goal return has become significantly more modest and he has not scored in the league for Spurs since the 2-1 defeat to Newcastle back in October. Factor in the remarkable rise of academy graduate Harry Kane and it is easy to see why some sections of supporters have written Adebayor off as surplus to requirements. Adebayor has only one year left to run on his current contract at Tottenham and could leave this summer .

Timothy Eli Thompson was born premature on March 4 without any nasal passages or sinus cavities, a condition so rare it only has a one in 197 million chance of happening. His mother Brandi McGlathery said Facebook removed a photo of her son a pro-life group tried to post to promote Eli's story. Scroll down for video . Timothy Eli Thompson was born without a nose in March in Alabama and his mom put his photo on Facebook . A picture of Eli was removed by Facebook after a pro-life group tried to post it to promote his story . The story was shared 30,000 times in six hours and the ban was lifted after complaints, WKRG reported. Brandi said: 'I posted the status with a link about it saying no one's going to keep me from posting photos of my child. 'If I can see completely distasteful things on Facebook all day long, then I can post a picture of my son. 'He was everywhere and he broke the internet!' Eli's parents, Brandi McGlathery (left) and Troy Thompson (right) are raising money for him on GoFundMe . Eli had to undergo a tracheotomy at only five days old. Doctors hope to be able to drill nasal passages in Eli's skull which will allow him to breathe when he is older. A family friend set up a GoFundMe page to help Eli's parents pay for his care. Brandi wrote: 'He will have to have a tracheoomy & a feeding bag inserted into his stomach, which is also not what I expected. 'I would be so grateful for anything anyone could spare, but if you cannot afford to help with money I will be just as appreciative for prayers for my sweet Eli. 'He has a long road a head of him & we need all the support we can get.' Doctors hope to be able to drill nasal passages in Eli's skull when he's older which will allow him to breathe . After he was born, Eli was treated at the USA Children's and Women's Hospital in Mobile for three weeks.

The justices ruled 5-4 that the law's requirement that most Americans obtain health insurance is constitutional. The court's decision means that the law's individual mandate will remain in place. The court also ruled that the law's expansion of Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor, is constitutional. But the justices said that the federal government cannot withhold all of its Medicaid funding from states that do not comply with the expansion. The court's ruling means that the law's individual mandate will remain in place. The court's decision was a major victory for President Barack Obama, who has made health care reform a centerpiece of his presidency. The law, which was signed in March 2010, is designed to expand health insurance coverage to more than 30 million uninsured Americans. The law's opponents, including the National Federation of Independent Business, argued that the individual mandate was unconstitutional because it required people to buy a product, health insurance, from a private company. The law's supporters, including the Obama administration, argued that the individual mandate was necessary to ensure that healthy people also buy insurance, which helps keep premiums down for everyone.

Italian Alex Bellini is to be subjected to the full force of the iceberg as it melts, cracks and even flips - while hopefully staying safe inside his small spherical cabin. The aim of the cabin fever-inducing stunt is to highlight how global warming will melt icebergs around the world and cause sea levels to rise. Scroll down for video . Italian Alex Bellini will live atop an iceberg in Greenland starting next year. He will live inside a contained ball (artist's illustration shown), with no means to escape for 12 months. The capsule will be 10ft (three metres) wide and could fit 10 people - but Mr Bellini will remove all of the seats apart from one, for himself . Mr Bellini, 36, is seeking funding for his project, called Adrift, which he hopes to begin in November 2016. Previous feats by the explorer include running more than 14,000 miles (22,500km), rowing more than 21,000 miles (34,000km) and spending 560 days in isolation. He has rowed both the Atlantic and Pacific and insists he favours challenges where there is a perceived lack of control. The capsules, initially designed essentially as escape pods for areas at risk of tsunami, can hold from two to ten people and range in price from \u00a38,000 to \u00a313,500 ($12,000 to $20,000). Four are currently in use in Japan, while two are in the US. Mr Bellini will use one at the upper scale, 10ft (three metres) wide - although he\u2019ll remove all the seats except one for himself. Inside he\u2019ll have exercise equipment, such as a stationary bike, in addition to supplies for the year such as food and water. But his latest venture represents a whole new challenge as he will have to deal with intense isolation and undergo serious psychological tests as he copes with being alone for 12 months.

The splatters of blood on the checklist for the very first US spacewalk were from an astronaut as he frantically battled to close the hatch door of the spacecraft after a historic venture. But the Gemini 4 mission of June 1965 ultimately proved successfully, and paved the way to astronauts walking on the moon for the first time four years later. A complete 13-page checklist, including a bloodstained document seen at the front), from the Gemini 4 mission in June 1965 is tipped to sell for a huge \u00a380,000 ($120,000). The list shows the various steps the astronauts had to go through when opening and closing the hatch to space . Gemini 4 launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on 3 June 1965 with two astronauts on board. One, Ed White, was tasked with performing the first US spacewalk, less than three months after Soviet Alexey Leonov had completed the first spacewalk in history. The two astronauts on the Gemini 4 mission were Jim McDivitt and Ed White. The Gemini programme of the 1960s was designed to develop and test capabilities that would ultimately land humans on the moon in the Apollo missions. The first crewed Gemini flight, Gemini 3, lifted off Launch Pad 19 at Cape Canaveral in Florida on March 23, 1965. Nasa's two-man Gemini spaceflights demonstrated that astronauts could change their capsule's orbit, remain in space for at least two weeks and work outside their spacecraft. They also pioneered rendezvous and docking with other spacecraft. All were essential skills to land on the moon and return safely to Earth. They orbited Earth 66 times over four days and, on the first day, Ed White donned a spacesuit and drifted out of the cramped capsule. He spent 20 minutes in space on the spacewalk, or extravehicular activity", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [17.742836952209473], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1733684687.1237955}

The site is about 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas.

The damage was just part of the destruction caused by cowboy builders who had been called in to fix a leak in the Beckle-Raymond's three bedroom property in North London. Instead, they left Phillip, his wife Gaby and their two young children, Orion and Aurielle, in an unsafe building with no roof while they ran off with \u00a317,000 of their money. Scroll down for video . Phillip and Gaby outside their London home which was left a wreck thanks to cowboy builders . 'When the builders walked out, we only had tarpaulin protecting the house throughout winter,' Gaby explains on Channel 5 show Britain's Horror Homes. 'When it rained, water started coming in, it was raining inside our house. The box room caved in, the bathroom became bowed, the ceiling will fall in the children's room. 'The most terrifying experience was the ceiling falling in the bedroom where we used to sleep. It collapsed where our bed used to be. We weren't in room at time thankfully.' For six months, the family were forced to live in one room of the house as they couldn't afford to get the problems fixed straight away, having already shelled out to the cowboy builders who left them in the lurch. Phillip, a civil servant, said: 'The house was crumbling around us, we had to turn off the lights as water was getting into electricity, it was that time of year when it was getting dark at 4pm, it was miserable. I hated leaving Gaby and the children like that when I had to go to work.' Phillip and Gaby had used all their savings to buy the property five years before for \u00a3325,000. The builders left the family with no roof and just\u00a0tarpaulin protecting the house from the winter elements. As a result, rain got into the property causing ceilings to collapse .

Footage shows the driver of a black SUV, identified as 49-year-old Laura Michelle Mayeaux, coming off at the 397 exit and veering over to the wrong side of the lane. She then steers head-on into a truck which rolls over on its side with debris flying everywhere. As the back end of the 18-wheeler swings out, it pushes a red pickup truck off course. Thick black skid marks can be seen on the tarmac as smoke fills the air. Rivera told\u00a0waxahachietx.com\u00a0that once things came to a standstill he got out of his vehicle to see if he could offer any assistance to the parties involved before authorities arrived. The incident, which occurred just past 6pm, shut the highway for around two hours. Mayeaux, from Waco, Texas, was transported to Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas because of the injuries she sustained during the wreck.

Federici tries desperately to stop the ball going over the line after it rolled through his legs and out of his grasp . 'When he comes into training we'll have a little chat but he'll be fine. He's a professional.' The incident was reminiscent of Robert Green's error in England's 2010 World Cup opener against the USA, when Clint Dempsey's strike got through him.

He then used those passwords to log on to their accounts himself . After hacking into the university computer system, Uddin changed the marks that he had been given for previous assessments .

He plugged these into the back of a number of staff computers at the University of Birmingham where he was studying . The device records everything which is typed into the keyboard and saves the data . Uddin, from Birmingham, was in his final year of a bio-science course . At the time of the hacking he was expected to achieve a 2:2 degree . He was jailed for four months at Birmingham Crown Court on Thursday after admitting six charges which were in breach of the Computer Misuse Act . Sentencing him, Judge James Burbridge said it was unclear why Uddin had tried to change his grades .

But add a touch of satin to it like Gwyneth Paltrow in her Alexander Wang version, and it goes from drab to deluxe in the blink of an eye. The Goop creator made hers a monochrome look by teaming the blush jacket with a flesh toned sweater dress underneath. The silken topper is great for an evening out and can be paired with cigarette trousers and strappy sandals for an elegant take on the menswear trend. Gwyneth's threads are from a few seasons back, so it's no longer available in stores. But our style edit is filled with lustrous alternatives from Missguided to Forever 21.

Robert Fidler, 66, secretly constructed the mock-Tudor castle complete with battlements and cannons and lived there with his family from 2002 . He unveiled it officially in 2006 when he thought he would be able to exploit a legal loophole that prevents enforcement action against a structure if no objections have been made for at least four years . But the local authority immediately laid siege by refusing to grant retrospective permission . Now, after numerous court appearances costing tens of thousands of pounds, Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles has finally ruled the four-bedroom home on Green Belt land at Honeycrocks Farm in Salfords, Surrey - worth well in excess of \u00a31million if sold on the open market - must be pulled down within 90 days . Mr Fidler yesterday compared the situation to an artist being made to destroy a piece of work . He added: 'I don't think I have any choice, to be honest. What they're saying now is if I don't demolish it in 90 days they'll put me in prison' . Mr Fidler started as a tenant farmer at Honeycrock Farm in the 1970s and bought the farmyard and ten acres of land in 1985 . There was no farmhouse, however, so from 2000 he began building the house around two grain silos at a cost of \u00a350,000 . Features include weathered brick and stone, carved wooden pillars and beams and a stained-glass dome above the stairwell . Mr Fidler and his wife, Linda, went to such lengths to hoodwink locals and the authorities that they kept their son Harry, now 14, off playschool on the day his class were due to paint scenes of their homes . 'We couldn't have him drawing a big blue haystack - people might have asked questions,' Mrs Fidler explained previously .

Males and females typically find a spot to mate in about five minutes. And the male will cover up the eggs to protect them from predators. Shown is another torrent frog, the Waterfall frog . The new species of torrent frog, reported by New Scientist, is called Hylodes japi. The amphibian, part of the Hylodes lateristrigatus group, is characterised by light stripes on its size, while it is also relatively small, according to the researchers. And when it comes to mating, this family of frogs has a unique trait not seen in other frogs. They typically like to live near fast streams and, if a pair decides to mate, they will spend five minutes searching for a private spot. \u2018The male quickly carves out a chamber by excavating the sand around small rocks at the bottom of the stream,\u2019 said Agata Blaszczak-Boxe from New Scientist. \u2018Then, like Christian Grey from Fifty Shades he invites his mate into his sex dungeon, which is only just big enough to fit the two amorous amphibians.\u2019 The amphibian, part of the Hylodes lateristrigatus group, is characterised by light stripes on its size, while it is also relatively small, according to the researchers. It was found in the Atlantic forest of Serra do Japi in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil . Once the female has laid her eggs, the male then covers up the entrance with sand from the stream. The reason for this is not only to protect the eggs from predators, but also from tadpoles of the species - as they are known to be cannibalistic. Finding the frogs wasn\u2019t easy, either - they are so secretive that the researchers had to don camouflage gear in order to observe them. A new species of glass frog (shown right) has been discovered with translucent skin so you can see its insides. The creature, named Hyalinobatrachium dianae, was found in the mountains of eastern Costa Rica and has a distinctive call.

Ronaldo, who scored more than 100 goals for Real and netted an impressive 62 international goals, was visiting his old club ahead of their Champions League quarter-final second-leg clash against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday. Odegaard opted to join Real Madrid after courting interest from a host of top clubs in Europe, including Manchester United and Liverpool, and signed a long-term \u00a340,000 a week contract with the Champions League winners in January. The former Stromgodset playmaker has trained with Carlo Ancelotti's first team regularly since his arrival, rubbing shoulder's with the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale. Odegaard is said to be on a different wave length to his Castilla team-mates because he rarely trains with them . The 16-year-old joined Real Madrid for \u00a32.3million in January signing a long-term \u00a340,000 a week contract . But the Norwegian wonderkid has found life tough at the Spanish giants in recent weeks. First team coach in waiting Zinedine Zidane dropped Odegaard from his Castilla side earlier this month after a dramatic downturn in results since his arrival. There have been suggestions that his presence in the side has riled team-mates that feel Odegaard training with the first team three times a week means he lacks cohesion in the B team. Real Madrid are desperate for the Castilla side to win promotion to the second tier of Spanish football and Zidane has to decide whether that goal is more attainable without the young talent.\nArticle: (CNN) -- The U.S. government has been secretly collecting the telephone records of millions of U.S. customers of Verizon under a top secret court order, according to a report", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [16.206758499145508], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1733684998.6413107}

The court ruled 5-4 in favor of Maryland police who took DNA samples from a man who was arrested for assault. The man, Alonzo King, was later acquitted of the charges. The court's decision overturned a Maryland court ruling that said taking DNA samples from people who had not been convicted of a crime was unconstitutional. The court's majority opinion, written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, said that DNA samples are no different than fingerprints, which are routinely taken from people who are arrested. \"Taking and analyzing a cheek swab of the arrestee's DNA is, like fingerprinting and photographing, a legitimate police booking procedure that is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment,\" Kennedy wrote. The court's minority opinion, written by Justice Antonin Scalia, said that the court's decision \"will, indeed immediately, affect millions of individuals who have been arrested for serious offenses but not yet convicted.\" \"The court holds that the police may take DNA samples from arrestees when they are booked,\" Scalia wrote. \"The court does not hold that such samples may be taken from arrestees when they are released, or that they may be taken from arrestees who are released without being charged.\" The court's decision was hailed by law enforcement officials. \"This is a victory for law enforcement and for the public,\" said Chuck Canterbury, national president of the Fraternal Order of Police. \"The court's decision will help law enforcement agencies solve and prevent crimes, and it will help protect the public from dangerous criminals.\" The court's decision was also praised by civil liberties groups. \"The court's decision is a victory for civil liberties and for the rule of law,\" said Catherine Crump, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union. \"The court has recognized that the Fourth Amendment protects our privacy and that", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [16.7132785320282], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1733685015.3736928}

Ms Waddington described watching her daughter battle the eating disorder as a 'horrific' ordeal. 'I felt so out of control and every day is a battle.

Prince George's County Police have released a piece of surveillance footage which shows a person pushing the empty chair in a parking lot. They're asking anyone with information about the case to contact investigators. The film appears to show a dark-haired white male dressed in a jacket and pants. A cash reward is being offered. Commenting on the incident, Capt. Ken Humbel said: 'This family already faces challenges and shouldn't be burdened with the emotional and financial stress of the theft of this wheelchair.

The order, issued by the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, requires Verizon on an \"ongoing, daily basis\" to give the National Security Agency information on all telephone calls in its systems, both within the U.S. and between the U.S. and other countries. The court order was granted in April and is good until July 19, the Guardian reported, citing documents provided by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. The Guardian said the order requires Verizon to provide the NSA with the \"metadata\" of calls, including the numbers of both parties on a call, the location of the caller and the duration of the call. The newspaper said the order does not include the content of the calls. The Guardian said the order does not apply to Verizon's newFiOS service, which it said was not included in the order.

The cost of paying for rising numbers of deaths as the unprecedented numbers of post-World War Two babies come to the end of their lives may be too much for many families, a report said. It predicted that numbers of deaths in Britain, which have been falling for 40 years, will start to go up and increase by 20 per cent over the next two decades. At the same time the price of a funeral is rising fast, thanks to higher costs for cremation, rising undertakers\u2019 bills as funeral firms are faced with bad debts, and the increasing fees demanded by churches. Deaths in Britain, which have been falling for 40 years, will start to go up and increase by 20 per cent over the next two decades, a report by a think tank has found (file photo) The report, prepared by an old age think tank, the International Longevity Centre-UK, and backed by insurance firm OneFamily, suggests that younger people who already feel financially hard pressed in comparison to their parents will still be under money pressure even after their deaths. Younger people are finding it increasingly difficult to afford homes or to start families, and in the long-term their pensions are much less secure than those of their parents, many of whom enjoyed the generous and fast-disappearing defined benefit pension system. The report from ILC-UK to be published next week said that death rates are set to go up following a long period in which medical advances, better diet, healthier lifestyles and the growing unpopularity of smoking, and the decline of dangerous heavy industrial jobs, have meant fewer people have been dying despite a rising population. \u2018After decades of the number of deaths in the UK falling, 2015 will mark a tipping point where the historic trend starts to reverse,\u2019 it said. \u2018As the oldest of the baby boomer generation move through their later years, deaths are predicted to rise by 20 per cent.\u2019 It added: \u2018This will have significant implications for current forecasts of funeral costs and highlights a growing need for families to broach the delicate subject of end of life expenses.\u2019 A 'simple' funeral", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [16.786932468414307], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1733685083.1620436}

The proposal is part of a broader effort to overhaul the nation's health care system, which is expected to be unveiled in the coming weeks. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the plan would allow insurance companies to sell policies in any state, regardless of where they are based. The official said the proposal is still being discussed and could change. The idea of allowing insurance companies to sell policies across state lines has been a long-standing goal of Republicans, who say it would increase competition and lower costs. But Democrats have been skeptical, arguing that it would lead to a race to the bottom, with insurers offering the cheapest policies in the states with the fewest regulations. The official said the administration is looking at ways to address those concerns, such as requiring insurers to offer a basic package of benefits.

A spring resurgence of five wins and a draw in their last six games has propelled Roberto Martinez's side into the top half of the Premier League, and the likes of Leon Osman, Phil Jagielka, Ross Barkley and Romelu Lukaku were all present to pass on advice to the next generation of talent. Players from the under-6 to under-11 age groups joined the Blues' senior stars for a training session at the Halewood complex, with the fun-filled occasion including games of head tennis and shooting drills overseen by manager Martinez and his coaching staff. Leon Osman shares a joke with two of the Everton academy players as Ross Barkley looks to get involved . Phil Jagielka larks around at the Academy Day as he teaches a youngster an unorthodox scorpion clearance . James McCarthy was also in attendance at the Academy Day, pictured in a passing drill he will be familiar with . Tyias Browning, who made his senior debut earlier this season in the Merseyside derby against Liverpool at Anfield, told Evertonfc.com that the experience rekindled fond memories for him. The Academy graduate said: 'This is my second one as part of the first team but I still remember when I did it as an Academy player. We were training with the likes of Big Dunc [Duncan Ferguson] and Joseph Yobo then but it's been great to see the smiles on a lot of kids' faces today. 'The Club really look after the younger players and Finch Farm is a special place to be. Today has been good fun and I think we've had as much fun as the kids!' Academy Director Tim Devine added: It's a great opportunity for the six to 11-year-olds to interact with the players, It's a great example of the family atmosphere that exists at the club. The manager and his backroom staff are all here, and it's fantastic.' Romelu Lukaku watches on as a youngster celebrates a goal during one of the small-sided games yesterday .

From Friday to Monday, a total of 8,480 migrants were rescued, according to the Italian coast guard, which said it received on Monday -- alone -- SOS calls from 20 boats in distress. On Tuesday, a spokesman with Save the Children told CNN the group fears 400 migrants could be missing, citing testimony from survivors who said their ship carrying 550 people capsized in the Mediterranean Sea about 80 miles off the Libyan coast. The Italian coast guard, however, told CNN that while it is taking the report seriously, it cannot confirm such an incident and has not yet found evidence at sea to indicate a migrant boat carrying approximately 550 has capsized with 145 rescued. An operation that included boats and planes did not find any survivors, nor bodies, nor any evidence to indicate a particular boat capsized, Coast Guard official Filippo Marini said. There has been a recent upsurge in migrant boats crossing the Mediterranean into Italy and an increase in rescues performed by the Italian Coast Guard to aid migrant boats. Why migrants are dying trying to reach Italy . According to the International Organization for Migration, Italy registered more than 10,000 migrants arriving in the first three months of 2015, and about 2,000 were rescued at sea during the first weekend of April in the Channel of Sicily. Most migrants recorded this year come from countries in West Africa as well as Somalia and Syria, the IOM said. They use Libya as a country of transit. At least 480 migrants have died while crossing the Mediterranean since the beginning of the year, often because of bad weather and overcrowded vessels used by smugglers, the IOM said. Sometimes the captains and crews abandon the ships, leaving passengers to fend for themselves. Last week: 978 migrants rescued in one day in Mediterranean Sea .

The new findings come from experts who conducted one of the world's largest studies into the effects of HRT - used to ease the effects of menopause . The Women's Health Initiative in the US and the Million Women Study in the UK have both revealed strong evidence that HRT increases a woman's risk of breast, womb and ovarian cancers . The Million Women Study, a collaboration between Cancer Research UK and the NHS, results suggested that women who are using combined HRT have double the risk of breast cancer compared to non-users . And researchers found if women use HRT for more than 10 years, their risks are even higher . Now scientists involved in the Women's Health Initiative study have warned, after further follow-ups, that women who take the combined oestrogen and progesterone HRT therapy continue to have a high risk of breast cancer, up to eight years after they stop treatment . After going through the menopause a woman's ovaries stop producing the hormone oestrogen . It triggers menopausal symptoms including hot flashes and mood swings . HRT treats the body by introducing female sex hormones . There are three types, oestrogen-only HRT, cyclical HRT - where oestrogen is taken continuously but progesterone is given either monthly or every three months - and continuous combined HRT, where both female sex hormones are taken at the same time . In the early 1990s, some smaller studies suggested the therapy would reduce a woman's risk of coronary heart disease and osteoporosis . To examine whether that was the case, the Women's Health Initiative in the US was tasked with investigating . They enrolled more than 26,000 women aged 50 to 79 in the study . Meanwhile, in the UK \u00a0another key study, the Million Women Study, explored the effects of HRT on women aged 50 or over . Both concluded that women prescribed HRT were at a higher risk of breast cancer, than those not receiving the treatment .

The former child star turned Real Housewife discusses her demons in an emotional interview with Dr. Phil set to air April 28, her first for a national audience since the arrest. Among the topics the 50-year-old is slated to discuss is her longtime struggle with alcoholism. About her April 16 arrest, Richards reveals, 'I was angry and frightened and I was scared. I knew what I had done. The whole night is my fault. None of this would have happened if I didn\u2019t drink.'

Sat with Dr. Phil: Kim Richards is speaking out for the first time since her shocking arrest last week following a drunken altercation at The Beverly Hills Hotel . Contradicting reports: Some sources involved in production of Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills say that Kim Richard's protestations that she was sober last season were laughable - while others say she was doing better than ever . Currently, Kim is scheduled to appear at the Los Angeles Superior Court on May 10 following her April 16 incident at the Polo Lounge where she 'caused a disturbance at the hotel restaurant and was taken into custody at the Beverly Hills Police Department.' According to the Richards family friend, Kim's drunk actions were brought on after watching the three-part reunion for the seventh season, which left her 'distraught' and 'very embarrassed.' But that wasn't the only cause. Kim's ex-husband Monty Brinson - who is battling Stage IV cancer - continues to lean on her for support, which fans were able to watch on the recent RHOBH season.

A pioneering facial surgeon \u2018repeatedly\u2019 punched a patient in the head in an \u2018extraordinary\u2019 attempt to correct a fracture caused by an industrial accident, a medical tribunal has heard. Professor Ninian Peckitt, 63, claimed he had simply \u2018digitally manipulated\u2019 the patient\u2019s face as part of hospital treatment, but witnesses said that in reality he had actually been hitting him, the tribunal was told. The world-renowned surgeon, who has lectured on the use of titanium implants to treat disfigured patients and has been published in academic texts, faces being struck off the medical register after being accused of failing three of his patients. A Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service hearing in Manchester was told a man referred to as Patient A had suffered \u2018extensive injuries\u2019 to the right side of his face in an industrial accident. He was admitted to Ipswich Hospital in February 2012 where Professor Peckitt was working as an honorary locum consultant in oral and maxillo-facial surgery since the previous month. Christopher Hamlet, representing the General Medical Council, told the hearing: \u2018The case is not centred around the outcome, but the method of the surgery by way of the extraordinary allegation that he repeatedly punched the patient in the face.\u2019 He added that Patient A had fallen out of bed which had further displaced his facial fractures. The hearing was told Professor Peckitt embarked on a \u2018closed reduction\u2019 procedure, in which a patient is given anaesthetic before the fractured bone is manually put back together without surgery, and a cast or splint applied. Mr Peckitt was working as an honorary locum at Ipswich Hospital in Suffolk at the time of the alleged incident in February 2012. A medical tribunal will decide whether he should be struck off the register .

Thursday's match began to get scrappy after the White Sox's Jose Abreu was hit in the arm by  Ventura's pitch in the fourth inning. The very next inning, Royals' Mike Moustakas was also hit in the arm, this time by a pitch from Chris Sale, leading to a warning for both teams. But things continued to escalate until Eaton hit a comebacker (a ball batted directly back to the pitcher) at Ventura in the seventh inning. The Royals starter picked up a ground ball but instead of throwing it to first for the out, he appeared to stop for a moment and stare at the pitcher. Umpires ejected a total of five players from both teams after the fight after the seventh inning of Thursday's game at Chicago's U.S. Cellular Field, Illinois . The pair exchanged words, and Eaton is alleged to have shouted an expletive at Ventura, who was said to have shouted one back before he threw to first base to end the inning.

Mark Bennett of Glasgow will be first choice for outside-centre but it could be a fight between Peter Horne of Warriors and Duncan Taylor of Saracens, who missed the Six Nations through injury, for the inside-centre jersey. Scotland player Matt Scott in action during the RBS Six Nations match between against Ireland at Murrayfield . The Edinburgh medical staff had hoped that Scott\u2019s shoulder would heal naturally but have decided further surgery is required as there has been no improvement over the last three weeks. A club spokeswoman said: \u2018It had been hoped that Matt would be able to manage his injury but, following consultation with specialists at Spire Murrayfield Hospital, the decision to perform an investigative arthroscopy was taken. \u2018This resulted in him requiring a further surgical procedure to help deal with his shoulder complaints. \u2018Matt will continue his rehabilitation programme with the Edinburgh Rugby medical team and won\u2019t play again this season.\u2019 Scott was putting a brave face on having his season cut short by this latest injury blow. In a tweet, the Scotland and Edinburgh centre said: \u2018Gutted that my season is over already after getting surgery. \u2018Brings an end to a frustrating year for me but positive about next few months.\u2019 Edinburgh are short of cover in the centre positions and will now rely on New Zealander Phil Burleigh and South African Andries Strauss \u2014 who both started in the quarter-final away win over London Irish in the absence of Scott \u2014 from now until the end of the season.

The BBC's Political Editor announced at the start of March that he would be taking some weeks off for treatment for a rare lung tumour. But he expressed hopes he would be fit again in time to cover 'the election proper'. Last night he returned to the BBC's News at Six to analyse the Labour's party's manifesto from the studio. BBC political editor Nick Robinson made a brief return to TV screens last night (pictured), although his voice sounded weak and strained following his cancer surgery . Mr Robinson's voice sounded weak and strained after his treatment for a bronchial carcinoid tumour which involved surgery to stop cancer spreading to other parts of the body. Afterwards he tweeted: 'Good to be back on air. Don't worry about the voice. It doesn't hurt and I'm not risking my recovery.' He said he was listening to his doctors and speech therapist. His return comes at a vital stage of the campaign, when the parties lay out their programmes for government to voters. The Tories' manifesto is unveiled today and the Liberal Democrats' is on Wednesday. Mr Robinson, 51, who is married with three children, has been sent an outpouring of good wishes, led by Prime Minister David Cameron. In a message recorded for the BBC website earlier yesterday, Mr Robinson said his return was a 'small step' and he did not expect to return to the campaign trail full-time at this stage. 'I'm taking my next small step back to reporting the election after my recent operation. As you can hear, my voice is still recovering and it's got a way to go yet. I'm not ready to go on the campaign trail full-time, but I will be watching this week's manifesto launches and the big opposition parties' debate on Thursday. 'I'll be blogging and I hope doing a little bit of broadcasting like this too. I would like to thank all those people who have sent me good wishes \u2013 it's really strengthened me.

The two-bedroom apartment in Los Angeles' Fairfax district is listed for $4,565 (\u00a33,016) a month, or $1,142 (\u00a3754) a week. Scroll down for video . The two-bedroom apartment is inside a 1920's building on Spaulding Avenue L.A.'s Fairfax district. A picture taken of Kurt Cobain in the early 90s, sitting on the end of the double bed he shared with Courtney Love. And with a parrot resting on his head, of course. The graffiti, however, has long since disappeared . Now its current owner, Brandon Kleinman, 31, has listed it on Airbnb. He wrote on the page advertising it: 'The place is the perfect combination of comfort, style, location and...rock n' roll history. 'Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love lived in the home during the height of Nirvana's musical influence 91-92 to be specific. 'At the time, Kurt was focused on song writing and his artwork, much of which was created in the apartment. 'He (Cobain) was particularly into painting during this time and even decorated the walls in the living room and bedroom.' 'His favourite spot in the house: the bathtub. In it, he wrote the song 'Heart-Shaped Box.' The couple lived in the apartment in 1991 and 1992, just before Frances Bean Cobain was born . It is described as 'beautiful, decorated and clean' - a far cry from the squalor revealed in photographs taken when Cobain moved out in 1992 . According to Charles R. Cross's 2001 Cobain biography Heavier Than Heaven, the singer and his wife rented the unit for $1,100 (\u00a3727) a month. During the time they lived there, Love was pregnant with Frances Bean Cobain, while Cobain was focusing on song writing and his artwork, much of which was created in the apartment.

Graeme Finlay, 53, insisted he acted in self-defence after being attacked by Ron Phillips, 70, wielding his crutch. The 16-stone British Gas engineer, who was travelling alone, confronted Mr Phillips and his wife June, 69, about their rudeness in ignoring him when he joined their table for dinner, a court heard. The couple were knocked unconscious after he allegedly assaulted them outside their cabin. But yesterday Finlay said he only swung his arms to defend himself when Mr Phillips went for him with his crutch. He denied attacking Mrs Phillips. He claimed Mr Phillips threw a cup of cocoa in his face and hit him with the crutch when he demanded an apology. He told the court: \u2018I felt myself being struck by something sharp and I put my arms over my face to defend myself \u2013 I covered my face with my arms, I didn\u2019t want my eye poked out.\u2019 He said he swung his arms outwards and felt them connect with retired engineer Mr Phillips, from Middlesbrough. They were on board the Thomson Celebration liner off Lanzarote when the incident happened in January last year. Finlay, a Glaswegian, gave jurors at Teesside Crown Court a picture of the social pitfalls of the lone traveller when he described being snubbed in the restaurant. He said he enjoyed going to musical shows and filled his time with excursions, but dinner could be a \u2018bit awkward\u2019.

Pagan was paid $160,000 in his Senate role last year, the Washington Post reports. The paper states Pagan, 49, has worked for Cochran since he was 16 years old. He is charged with one count of possession and intent to distribute methamphetamine and one count of importing a controlled substance. The former is punishable by five to 40 years in prison, the latter by up to 20. Pagan was released on Friday after an initial court appearance. He will appear again on May 14. Court documents read by The Washington City Paper say Pagan admits he acquired three loads of drugs through a dealer. He is accused of buying the substances to exchange for sexual favors. Sen Cochran's spokesman Chris Gallegos confirmed a staff member had been arrested but refused to confirm further details. He told the City Paper: 'Our office is in the process of consulting with Senate legal counsel.' GBL, the drug Cochran allegedly acquired from a dealer in China, is similar to the date rape drug GHB. It is illegal to manufacture or sell either variant of the drug in the United States. Users can face two years in prison, suppliers up to 14 years.

A Connecticut juvenile court judge issued a written decision Wednesday denying a motion to let the teen, identified in court documents as \"Cassandra C.,\" go home. The judge also denied a motion for visitation. The 17-year-old is in remission after nearly six months of forced chemo treatments. On March 16, Michtom tried to convince the court that she should be able to return to her mother's home because she was no longer at imminent risk of harm from her illness. Michtom and attorney Michael Taylor, who represents Cassandra's mother, Jackie Fortin, released a written statement after receiving the judge's decision Wednesday: \"We are disappointed in this ruling, not least of all because it draws a factual conclusion that is directly contradicted by the weight of the evidence. We're conferring with our clients now about next steps, including whether to take another appeal.\" Cassandra was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma in September and medical experts gave her an 85% chance of survival if treated with chemotherapy. Without it, doctors said at the time, she was likely to die within two years. She started chemotherapy in November but ran away after two days, according to court documents, when she decided she did not want to put the poison of the treatment into her body. In December, a judge ordered the young woman to be under the custody of the Connecticut Department of Children and Families. At that time, she was admitted to Connecticut Children's Medical Center in Hartford and has remained there since then. Doctors surgically implanted a port in Cassandra's chest to administer chemotherapy medications, which began in spite of legal maneuvers to halt them.

Lisa McElroy, 50, reportedly sent the explicit link to her Drexel University students under the subject line 'Great article on writing briefs' on March 31. McElroy said she was 'mortified' and 'in terrible shape' when she found out what she had done, she wrote in a column for the Washington Post. Respected Drexel University law professor Lisa McElroy, 50, who made national headlines last month after accidentally emailing her students a porn link, has spoken out about reclaiming her dignity since the scandal . The legal writing professor, who earned a doctorate from Harvard Law School, writes that she was sure she had lost her 'dignity forever' when news of the scandal first broke. 'Everyone was talking about me,' she said. 'Everyone was speculating about whether I watched porn, or used sex toys, or liked kinky sex. Some people were calling for my job and law license.' The professor said she would not divulge in her column how the mistake happened. 'If you're hoping to find out here how that happened, among the many possibilities that have been raised by gleeful commentators, I\u2019m sorry to tell you you\u2019re going to be disappointed.' But McElroy did explain her concern that, with a profession where she teaches 'students to project a dignified image' and 'possess integrity', people would no longer believe the teacher could follow her own lessons. Drexel conducted an internal investigation after the incident and found that McElroy, a tenured professor, had not violated the the university's sexual harassment and misconduct policy. The university said in a statement that federal law requires it investigate all reports of 'inappropriate behaviors of a sexual nature'. The professor defends Drexel's decision to investigate the matter. She wrote that critics of the university were 'dismissing the dignity of the law' and 'giving no consideration to an atmosphere in which the law exists to protect people and an investigation may be necessary'. But McElroy said she wondered why no one thought to question the 'dignity of those", "decoding_steps": [512], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [17.02332305908203], "accept_lengths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "acceptance_rate": 0.0}], "tstamp": 1733685683.6399024}

Internet companies iiNet Limited, Internode, Amnet Broadband, Dodo Services, Adam Internet and Wideband Networks were all affected by the ruling . But legals experts say even if you are hit with a legal threat there are several ways to defend the accusations, Fairfax Media reports. iiNet's former chief regulatory officer, Steve Dalby, said the letter was not proof and it would be difficult for the film's studio to prove someone downloaded it. He said those hit with legal letters should also consider whether anyone else may have had access to their network. 'They can't detect downloaders so if I downloaded it but never shared it I wouldn't be concerned about it,' Mr Dalby said. 'If they're not guilty and had an open access point that was unsecured or were very free to giving their password out to people then maybe they do have the defence that it wasn't them. 'Most of the agreements state the account holder is responsible for the use of the account but there's no formal, legal obligation for customers to secure their WiFi.' He said if a letter did show up, it was important to seek legal advice. Slaters Intellectual Property Lawyers' Anny Slater told Fairfax Media there were many avenues for people to get advice. 'As to people getting access to justice and support, this case has brought to light the situation so there are many avenues for people to get advice on a cost effective basis,' she said. 'Some might argue innocence, some might argue that they didn't understand the repercussions, some might argue that the only access to the material was this way because prices were so high.' iiNet has warned its customers to expect speculative invoicing - an 'intimidating' letter demanding significant sums of up to US$7000 for an alleged infringement, or threatening court action .

Leigh Griffiths (left) fired Celtic into an early lead in their encounter against Inverness . Griffiths runs over to celebrate his opening strike with the travelling Celtic supporters . Griffiths (right) celebrates his third minute goal with his Celtic team-mates, but the lead did not last long . In three games this season, there has been nothing between these two teams. In August, Celtic lost 1-0 at Tulloch Caledonian Stadium, before gaining revenge with a 1-0 win at Parkhead in November. On Saturday, Deila\u2019s side were held to a draw by Caley Thistle. Yet while Celtic were surprisingly poor, the evidence from the weekend also suggests that Inverness possess a potent blend of passion and physicality which, more so than any other side in the country, seems to knock Deila\u2019s men out of their stride. For goalkeeper Craig Gordon, Saturday\u2019s 1-1 draw - which included a quick-fire goal from Leigh Griffiths and one in immediate response Edward Ofere - served as a warning shot against complacency in the quest for a rare domestic clean sweep. The Scotland goalkeeper believes his side will need to fight with every sinew when the two tribes renew hostilities in Sunday\u2019s Scottish Cup semi final at Hampden if Celtic\u2019s dream of winning a fourth treble is not to be shattered. \u2018It\u2019s a good little reminder that we are in for a big fight next week,\u2019 said the Scotland international. \u2018Inverness are a good team. They are big and physical - but they can also pass the ball. \u2018They were up for it and they put us under a bit of pressure today. They\u2019ve got a little bit of everything about them and, on any given day, they are more than capable of winning a game. \u2018They pressed us high and they will try to do that again at Hampden.

That's where we want to be.' Curry led the Warriors with 34 points, hitting 13 of 25 shots and four three-pointers. All five Golden State starters scored in double figures. Guard Klay Thompson complemented Curry with 21 points, while power forward Draymond Green (15 points, 12 rebounds) and center Andrew Bogut (12 points, 14 rebounds) recorded double-doubles.
